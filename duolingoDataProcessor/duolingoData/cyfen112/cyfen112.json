cover the CEFR levels A1 and A2 as taught on the LearnWelsh/*DysguCymraeg\nMynediad* and *Sylfaen* level courses for adults in Wales. See https://www.learnwelsh.cymru \n\nLet's start!\n\n####Greetings\n*Bore da* = Good morning \n\nThis has two parts:\n\n-  *bore* - morning\n-  *da* - good\n\nNote that the usual word order for describing things in Welsh is the noun followed by the adjective, so the Welsh *Bore da* (literally 'morning good') becomes 'Good morning' when translated into English.\n\nSimilarly, *Nos da* (Good night) which, as in English, is what we say to someone as a farewell last thing at night: \n\n-  *nos* - night\n\nIn the first lesson, we use some Welsh first names to help to make the sentences:\n\n-  *Dylan, Dewi* and *Owen* are men's names,\n-  *Celyn* can be used by both men and women, and\n-  *Megan* is a woman's name.\n\n**Note** - Following the usual practice in Wales, personal names are not translated or changed in spelling between Welsh and English. Where a place has a different name in both languages, though, we do translate them.\n\n**Note** that *Draig*/Dragon is not used as a name in Wales! The *Draig Goch* is a national symbol.\n\nPlease take the time to read the following notes:\n\n####Section notes - 'Tips and Notes'\n\nMost sections of this course have notes explaining new patterns and usages, or giving background information about a topic.\n\nDo read them so that you can get the most out of the course. We keep them updated in response to feedback, especially to points and questions raised in the discussion forums of the course. To see how to find the course notes, go to https://forum.duolingo.com/topic/924/hot and read the discussion 'Course tips and notes'.  The 'duome' link there is useful for browsing all the notes in one place.  We recommend reading the notes for each new section as you start it.\n\n####Pronunciation\nNearly every sound in Welsh is also found in British English. Note that Welsh uses two letters as vowels that are usually treated as consonants in English, *w* and *y*.\nA fuller description of the Welsh alphabet is in the notes for a later part of the course.\n\nThere are some very good short videos by Welsh Plus on YouTube to help in learning Welsh pronunciation. Look on the web for 'Welshplus Youtube pronunciation basics'.\nWe recommend that you work your way through all of the videos in the series - they are very clear, and far better than trying to follow any written description of pronunciation. Go back to them at intervals as you follow the course. If you are still unclear about the pronunciation of individual words, many have live voice recordings in the www.gweiadur.com on-line dictionary or at forvo.com.\n\n\n####Typing accented characters.\nDuo provides some accented characters in a menu, but this does not give the full range required in Welsh, so:\n\n-  If you are in Britain, try setting your region to UK - on iOS that gives you *ŵ, ŷ, î, ê, ï, á, etc*, as pop-up characters if you keep the *w, y* or other vowel keys depressed for a second.\n-  Otherwise, install the iOS/Android Swiftkey app with its Welsh keyboard.\n-  On MacOS, use the Welsh keyboard layout and use the Keyboard Viewer to see how to produce the accents. For example, type opt-w to get *ŵ*, or opt-8, i to get *ï*.\n-  On Windows you can use the UK extended keyboard layout to get accented characters. Or install the free 'To Bach v2' from https://www.interceptorsolutions.com/tobach Their website has instructions for using it.\n\n####Reporting system bugs\nThe volunteer course teams have no access to the underlying Duolingo software. Report software bugs here - https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204728264-How-do-I-report-a-bug-\n\n####Audio\nThe audio on this course is produced by a computer-generated voice. The voice has a neutral accent and usually gives the correct pronunciation or close to it. The course team can do nothing any glitches except to disable the sound for that word or sentence.\n\n####A note to Welsh speakers\n**Croeso i Duolingo!** This course is based on a colloquial register of Welsh as taught in the **DysguCymraeg Mynediad** and **Sylfaen** courses. It does not cover formal registers of Welsh, dialect or slang forms of Welsh. Please do not suggest alternative answers based on them. However, please do contribute to the course discussions!\n\n\n####Opportunities for learning Welsh in Wales\n\n**In Wales**, all Welsh for adults courses are organised by a Welsh government agency - The Nartional Centre for Learning Welsh (Y Ganolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Genedlaethol).

We do this by putting our name, Sioned, say, at the front of the sentence:\n\n**Sioned dw i** - I am Sioned = (literally, \"Sioned am I\")\n\nSioned would not say * 'Dw i'n Sioned' - that is the wrong order of words for this kind of sentence - the name, role or occupation, etc, has to come first.\n\n**Remember** - It can be interesting to learn the Welsh and English equivalents of personal names, but we do not translate people's names between the two languages.\n\nWelsh has **no indefinite article** (a / an). So, a dragon could say:\n\nDraig dw i - I am a dragon (lit. \"A dragon am I\").\n\n**Confirming someone's name** - perhaps you misheard it\n\nTo confirm someone's name or occupation, we can form a question simply by raising our voice a little at the end of the phrase:\n\n**Sioned dych chi?** - Are you Sioned?\n**Draig dych chi?** - Are you a dragon?\n\nNote - you would not ask 'Dych chi Sioned?' - that order of words is incorrect when asking about names and occupations or roles.\n\n####Asking a Name\nThe question Pwy dych chi? means Who are you? It can sound abrupt in English, but it is perfectly acceptable in everyday Welsh speech and is often heard.\n\n**Note** - In these lessons, the new characters Gareth (male), Sioned (female), and Eleri Lingo (female) are introduced. Apart from learning a few more common Welsh first names, these will give you some useful listening practice. The word draig (dragon) is also introduced.\n\n**Note** - This unit introduces the letter and sound /ch/, which is not used in English, but it is pronounced the same as 'Loch' in Scotland. If you have not already done so, look at the videos here to learn how to pronounce things in Welsh.\n\n####Opportunities for learning Welsh in Wales\n\n**In Wales**, all Welsh for adults courses are organised by a Welsh government agency - The Nartional Centre for Learning Welsh (Y Ganolfan Dysgu Cymraeg Genedlaethol). Full details of all the classes, open to anyone in Wales, the UK and the rest of the world, are to be found on the website \n####learnwelsh.cymru\n\n----","urlName":"Greet2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":18,"id":"71ae0471b816e05df302b22afb29228c","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Present 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Present 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"**Please remember** that there are occasional known glitches in the computer-generated voice - unfortunately the course team can do nothing about this, so please do not report audio faults.  They have already been noted and they may be able to be fixed in the future.\n\n----\n####Simple Sentences\n\nEvery verb can be used to make simple sentences in a standard way using forms of another verb, *bod* (meaning 'being' or 'to be').  We have already met two forms of *bod*:\n\n-  *dw i* - I am, and\n-  *dych chi* - you are\n\nNow:\n\n-  *hoffi* is one of several words meaning 'liking' or 'to like'\n\nTo say 'I like', we link 'I am' *(dw i)* with 'liking' *('hoffi')* using a small word which does not actually translate into English when it is used like this - *yn*.  In this pattern, the basic word *yn* is changed to *'n* if it follows a word ending in a vowel.  So, 'I like' is made up of:\n\n-  *dw i + yn + hoffi*\n\ngiving us (remembering that *yn => 'n* after a vowel):\n\n-  *dw i'n hoffi...*  - I like...\n\n**Note** how *dw i* and *'n* join together.\n\nAnd so, following the same idea but this time using *dych chi* (you are), we get:\n\n-  *Dych chi'n hoffi...* - You like...\n\nSo, what do you and I like?  Coffee, perhaps, and the Welsh for 'coffee' is *coffi*:\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi coffi* - I like coffee\n-  *Dych chi'n hoffi coffi* - You like coffee\n\n(**Note** that although *'n/yn* here is not actually translated into English, it does act as a marker showing that the action is 'in progress', unfinished.  Later in the course you will find other words used instead of *'n/yn* to mark completed or newly completed actions.)\n\n----\n####But we don't like coffee...\nThe usual word for 'not' in Welsh is *ddim*:\n\n-  Dw i **ddim**... - I am not...\n\nSo,\n\n-  *Dw i **ddim** yn hoffi...* - I do not like...\n\n**Note** that *yn* is separated from *dw i ddim* by a space - it does not get changed to *'n*.  That is because *ddim* ends with a consonant, not a vowel.\n\n-  *Dw i ddim yn hoffi coffi.* - I don't like coffee.\n-  *Dych chi ddim yn hoffi coffi.* - You do not like coffee.\n\nNote that Welsh makes no distinction here between the English 'do not' and 'don't.'\n\n----\n####Do we like things?\n\nWith *dw i...* and *dych chi...*, we can turn them into questions just by lifting our tone of voice at the end of the sentence, as we do when asking a question in English:\n\n-  *Dych chi'n hoffi selsig?* - Do you like sausages?\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi coffi?* - Do I like coffee?\n\n----\n####And\n\nThe word for 'and' is *a*.  It becomes *ac* before vowels and before a small number of other words:\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi pysgod **a** sglodion.* - I like fish and chips.\n-  *Dych chi'n hoffi orenau **ac** afalau?* - Do you like oranges and apples?\n\nWords starting with *p, t* or *c* change their first letter to *ph, th* or *ch* following *a* (and).  This is called an 'aspirate mutation' and is practised later in the course.\n\n----\n####Some dialect variations\n\nWelsh has a number of dialects; four or five main ones, with large areas of geographical overlap.  Different generations also tend to use different language patterns, too, just as with any modern language.  You may live in one of those areas and you may already be learning some slight variations from the forms we generally use on this course.  Don't worry about it, just ask your local tutor for advice if this applies to you.\n\nOne common variation is in a phrase we introduce in this section - *dych chi* (you are).  In parts of north-west Wales in particular you may be learning this as *dach chi*, which reflects a local pronunciation.  All the way through this course you can respond with *dach chi* instead of *dych chi* if you wish.  Later in the course you will also meet *dach chi* being used as a prompt.  It is important to become familiar with some simple dialect variations as they do come up in the national media and you will hear them all over Wales because people travel around so much - we don't change the way we speak just because we are working and living in or visiting a different area.  There is some more information about the Welsh dialects in the notes for the later section called 'Dialects'.\n\n**Note** that in this introductory course we do not cover many dialect variations, just those few commonly taught in the two introductory levels in courses for adults in Wales under the national 'LearnWelsh' scheme (www.learnwelsh.cymru).\n\n----\nFurther information about learning Welsh is here - https://learnwelsh.cymru\n\n----","urlName":"Present-1"}],[{"bonus":true,"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":5,"id":"ca7b613c0c83406d79286d69985cbf5f","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":2,"name":"Idioms","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Idioms","skillType":"BONUS","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Ever wanted to express yourself in poetic Cymraeg?

Building a wide vocabulary is essential in learning a language, and there are many tools around to help you.  \n\nIn this unit, all the verbs are presented in the **present tense**. For example:\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi* - I like\n-  *Dw i'n yfed* - I drink/I am drinking\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi yfed te* - I like to drink tea\n\n**Remember** that the 'to' in 'to drink' in the third example is included in the meaning of the single Welsh word *yfed*.  *Yfed* means 'drinking' or 'to drink', so no additional Welsh word is needed for the 'to' in this pattern.  \n\n**yn** is used to link *dw i* etc to the following verb. It is usual to shorten it to*'n* when it follows a Welsh vowel *(a e i o u w y)*. This is normal for any positive sentence. When using a negative sentence, the *yn* is always full and again comes just before the verb-noun. For example:\n\n-  *Mae e**'n** yfed* - He is drinking *or* He drinks\n-  *Dw i**'n** yfed*- I am drinking *or* I drink\n-  *Dw i ddim **yn** yfed* - I am not drinking *or* I don't drink\n-  *Dw i ddim **yn** gwneud te* - I am not making tea\n\n----\n####*Cinio* - lunch or dinner\n\nJust as the basic structure of Welsh is very different from that of English - as in something as basic as word order, for example - Welsh words and English word do not always have a one-for-one translation.  In this section you will meet an example - *cinio* - which is used for both 'lunch' and 'dinner'.\n\nIn English, different people use different terms for the various meals of the day.  This course does not try to address that, but it is consistent in translating the various terms:\n\n-  *brecwast* - breakfast\n-  *cinio* - lunch **or** dinner  (regardless of whether you use the term 'dinner' for a midday or an evening meal)\n-  *te* - tea\n-  *swper* - supper\n\n----\n####Verb-nouns\nThe basic, dictionary-form of a verb in Welsh *(hoffi, yfed, prynu, etc)* is known as a verb-noun *(berfenw)*.  As you will see later in the course, verb-nouns can be used very flexibly in Welsh.  \n\nThe nearest equivalent in English is the 'ing-participle' form of verbs (liking, drinking, buying, etc) but it is often also translated as the 'to-infinitive' (to like, to drink, to buy, etc).\n\nIn a dictionary, a verb-noun is often idenitifed with the abbreviation *be* for *'berfenw'*.\n\n####Translating standalone verb-nouns\n**Please note** that on this course, if you are asked to translate a verb-noun on its own (for example, *bwyta, hoffi, yfed, etc*), and not as part of a longer phrase, you should use the forms 'xxxing' or 'to xxx'. ('eating', 'to eat', 'to like', 'drinking').  Do not answer with just 'xxx' (eat, like, drink, swim, etc) as those forms can often be mixed up with nouns (a swim, a drink, ...) or commands (eat!, drink!). When you look them up in a dictionary the distinction is made clear, but we cannot do that on Duo.\n\n----\n####Welsh pronouns\nIn colloquial Welsh, verbs are usually followed by their associated subject pronouns, for example *dw **i**, dych **chi**,*  (**I** am, **you** are), etc.  \n\n(In formal Welsh the pronouns are often dropped, but we do not use or accept formal registers of Welsh on this course.)\n\nFor reference, here is a table of the usual pronouns:\n\n|  *Cymraeg*  |    English    |         Notes           |\n| -------------- | -------------- |---------------------- |\n| *i* | I, me | sometimes *fi* |\n| *ti* | you | informal singular |\n| *e* or *o* | he, him | *e* in southern dialects, *o* in northern dialects; sometimes *fe, fo* |\n| *hi* | she, her | |\n| *ni* | we, us | |\n| *chi* | you | plural, and formal singular |\n| *nhw* | they, them | |\n\nYou will meet the verb-forms that go with each of these later in the course.\n\n----","urlName":"Present-2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"1939935bbe74c404ce01f338eaade2f5","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Days of the Week","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Days","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n#### Days of the week\n\nOn its own, the word *dydd* means 'day'. In combination with other words it is used in the names of the days of the week. \n\nMost of the days of week are named after planets in Welsh, and some are also very similar to the days of the week in Latin and the Romance languages.\n\n-  Sunday - *dydd Sul* -  (*Sul* is an old word for the Sun, no longer used for that)\n-  Monday - *dydd Llun* -  (*Llun* is an old word for the Moon, no longer used for that).\n-  Tuesday - *dydd Mawrth* - (*Mawrth* - the planet  Mars)\n-  Wednesday - *dydd Mercher* - (*Mercher*- the planet Mercury)\n-  Thursday - *dydd Iau* - (*Iau* - Jupiter.  Note that *Iau* starts with a capital *'i'*, not a lower case *L*)\n-  Friday - *dydd Gwener* - (*Gwener* - Venus)\n-  Saturday - *dydd Sadwrn* - (*Sadwrn* - Saturn)\n\n**Note** -  include *dydd* in the name of the day.\n\n----\n####Morning and afternoon\n\n-  *bore* = morning\n-  *prynhawn* = afternoon\n\nTo say 'Monday morning', Tuesday afternoon' and so on we just put the name of the day after the word for the time of day:\n\n-  *bore dydd Llun* = Monday morning, (but this is sometimes shortened to just *bore Llun*).\n\nSimilarly,\n\n-  Tuesday afternoon = *prynhawn dydd Mawrth* (but this is sometimes cut down to just *prynhawn Mawrth*).\n\nAll the names of the days of the week can be combined in this way for morning or afternoon.\n\n----\n####Night and evening\n\n*Nos* can be combined with the names of the days of the week to mean 'Sunday night' and so on.  It is also used in this way for the names of evenings:\n\n-  *nos Sadwrn* - Saturday night **or** Saturday evening\n-  *nos Sul* - Sunday night/evening\n-  *nos Iau* - Thursday night/evening\n\nSome names of days undergo a slight change (a soft mutation) when used with *nos*.  The reason for this is explained later in the course, so just learn these for now:\n\n-  *nos Lun* - Monday night/evening\n-  *nos Fawrth* - Tuesday night/evening\n-  *nos Fercher* - Wednesday night/evening\n-  *nos Wener* - Friday night/evening\n\n**Note** that we do not use *dydd* with *nos* - it has to be either one or the other, never both together.\n\n----\n####For the days of the week, always combine the name with some other element\n\n**Note** that there should always be something in front of the name of the day - *dydd Xxx, bore dydd Xxx, bore Xxx, prynhawn dydd Xxx, nos Xxx, etc* - do not use just the name of the day on its own, or it could be mistaken for the name of one of the planets.\n\n**Note** that *dydd, bore, prynhawn, nos* do not usually take a capital letter in the names of days unless at the beginning of a sentence or as part of a special day (for example, *Dydd Calan* - New Year's Day).\n\n----\n####'On' a particular day\n\nTo say that we are doing something 'on' Thursday, say, we do not use a separate word for 'on', we simply change the word *dydd* to *ddydd*:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **dd**ydd Gwener.* - I am working on Friday.\n\nThis change does not apply if we use *bore* or *prynhawn*:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio prynhawn dydd Sul.* - I am working on Sunday afternoon.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio bore dydd Iau.* - I am working on Thursday morning.\n\n**Note** that this form is **not** used for habitual timings such as saying 'I work on a Friday', 'I work on Fridays' or 'Do you watch television on Sundays?'  For that, we use the preposition *ar*:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **ar** ddydd Gwener.* - I work on Fridays; I work on a Friday; I work Fridays.\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i Aber **ar** nos Lun.* - I go to Aber on Monday evenings/on a Monday evening.\n\n**Note** that *ar* is also used for 'on' with dates and with named holidays such as *Dydd Nadolig* (Christmas Day), *Nos Galan* (New Year's Eve) and so on.\n\n----\n\nFurther information about learning Welsh is at http://www.duolingo.com/comment/13186004 and on the national LearnWelsh/*DysguCymraeg* website - http://learnwelsh.cymru\n\n----","urlName":"Days"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"650b8e05b6f085a5629f3b7589ee4e62","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Present Tense 3","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Present 3","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"In this unit, other forms of the present tense of *bod* (to be) are introduced.\n\n----\n####'You' - *Ti* and *Chi*\nAs in several other European lanaguages, Welsh has two forms of 'you', ***ti*** and ***chi***, and different forms of verbs are used with each:\n\n***Ti*** is only used with an individual, never with more than one person:\n\n-  When talking to an individual with whom you are on familiar terms, such as a friend, relative or close colleague.\n-  When talking to a child.\n-  When talking or praying to a deity.\n\n***Chi*** is used:\n\n-  When addressing more than one person, familiar or not.\n-  When talking with someone you don't know.\n-  With an individual in formal settings.\n\n----\n####The forms of *bod* (to be)\n\nThe pronouns we use are:\n\n-  *i* - I\n-  *ti* - you (singular familiar)\n-  *e, o* - he (sometimes *fe/fo*)\n-  *hi* - she\n-  *ni* - we\n-  *chi* - you (plural, and formal singular)\n-  *nhw* - they\n\n**Note** that for 'he', *e* is generally used in dialects in west, south and some of mid-Wales, *o* in north and other parts of mid-Wales.\n\nHere is the pattern of the present tense of *bod*:\n\n| Positive | Question | Negative | Translation |\n| -------- | -------- |------- |------ |\n|  *(ry)dw i*  | *(y)dw i?*  |  *(dy)dw i ddim* |  I am, am I?, I am not|\n|  *rwyt ti* | *wyt ti?*  | *dwyt ti ddim*| you (sing.) are..., etc.|\n| *mae e/o* | *ydy e/o?*| *dydy/dyw e/o ddim* | he is... etc. | \n| *mae hi* | *ydy hi?* | *dydy/dyw hi ddim* | she is... etc. | \n|  *(ry)dyn ni* | *ydyn ni?*  | *(dy)dyn ni ddim* | we are... etc.| \n| *(ry)dych chi* | *(y)dych chi?* | *(dy)dych chi ddim* | you (pl) are... etc.| \n|  *maen nhw* |  *ydyn nhw?*  | *(dy)dyn nhw ddim* | they are... etc |\n\n*(ry)dw i* shows the fuller form in brackets *(rydw)* compared to the basic spoken form taught on this course *(dw i)*.

The 'tips and notes' explain these as they come up for the first time.\n\n**Note** in dialects in south, west and parts of mid-Wales the pronoun 'he' is usually ***e***, while in north Wales and other parts of mid-Wales 'he' is usually ***o***.\n\n**Note** that on introductory courses using *DysguCymraeg* 'north' materials, you will be taught *dan ni, dach chi, dan nhw, etc*.  This reflects local pronunciation.\n\n**Note** that *mae* is also used with nouns, both plural and singular:\n\n-  *Mae'r plant yn chwarae.* - The children are playing.\n-  *Mae Siôn a Siân yn licio cerdded.* - Siôn and Siân like walking.\n-  *Mae'r car a'r beic yn las.* - The car and the bike are blue.\n-  *Mae Sioned yn hoffi fe.* - Sioned likes him.\n\n**Note** that with verbs the third person plural form is only used with the pronoun *nhw*.\n\n**Note** that *Yw...* is not used to start a question, only *Ydy...?* is used.  \n\n**Note** that the third person singular negatives *dyw* and *dydy* have the same meaning and are interchangeable.\n\n**Remember**, to form the present tense we use the appropriate part of the verb to be *(bod) + 'n/yn* and the required verb.  For example:\n\n-  *Dw i**'n** canu.* - I am singing.\n-  *Wyt ti**'n** canu?* - Are you singing?\n-  *Dyw e ddim **yn** canu.* - He is not singing.\n\nCourses in parts of north and mid-Wales may teach the forms *dan ni* and *dach chi, etc*, following local pronunciation.  Those forms are accepted on this Duolingo course.\n\n----\n####Emphatic sentences\nIn earlier section we saw that when identifying someone by their job or name, we put that first in the sentence:\n\n-  *Sam dw i.* - I'm Sam.\n-  *Athro dych chi?* - Are you a teacher?\n\nIn identifying sentences in the third person we use *ydy/yw* following the identifier, or with a plural, *ydyn*:\n\n-  *John yw e.* - He's John.\n-  *Mecanic yw hi.* - She is a mechanic.\n-  *Athrawes ydy hi?* - Is she a teacher?\n-  *Ffermwyr ydyn nhw?* - Are they farmers?\n\n----\n####More on Yes and No\nWe have already met the responses ***Ydw*** - '**Yes** (I am) and ***Nac ydw*** - '**No** (I am not). \n\nTo form the 'Yes' and 'No' in other persons, take the question form and remove the pronoun:\n\n-  *Ydy hi'n canu?* - Is she singing? -  *Ydy* - Yes (she is); *Nac ydy* - No (she is not)\n-  *Dych chi'n cerdded, Megan a Siôn?* -  *Ydyn* - Yes (We are); *Nac ydyn* - No (we are not)\n-  *Ydyn nhw'n bwyta? - Ydyn* - Yes (they are); *Nac ydyn* - No (they are not)\n\nIf the question starts with something other than the verb we use a much simpler yes/no system - *Ie/Nage*.

For example:\n\n-  *dw i eisiau...* - 'I am' + 'a want' = 'I want....'\n\nYou can follow *eisiau* with another noun or a verb-noun:\n\n-  *Dw i eisiau **siocled**.* - I want a **chocolate**.\n-  *Dych chi eisiau **mynd**.* - You want **to go**.\n\n**Note** - The noun *eisiau* does not have *'n/yn* in front of it.  The pattern is an exceptional one in Welsh.\n\n**Note** that Welsh makes no distinction between 'a chocolate', 'some chocolate' or 'chocolate' - there is no specific word for an indefinite 'a' or 'some' in this sense:\n\n-  *Dw i eisiau coffi.* - I want a coffee. = I want some coffee. = I want coffee.\n\n**Note** that in a negative sentence *coffi* may also mean '...any coffee':\n\n-  *Dw i ddim eisiau coffi.* - I do not want coffee. = I do not want a coffee. = I do not want any coffee.\n\n**Note** that *eisiau* is often pronounced *isie, isia* or *isio* .  The 'north' versions of the introductory *DysguCymraeg* courses teach the spelling *isio*. \n\n----\n####And\nThe word for 'and' is ***a***, (***ac*** before vowels):\n\n-  *afal a lemon ac oren* - an apple and a lemon and an orange\n\nThe vowels in Welsh are *a, e, i, o, u* - as in English, and also *w* and *y*.\n\nFor historical reasons, *ac* is also used before some other words that do not start with a vowel.  A common example is *mae*:\n\n-  *a + mae => ac mae*\n-  *Dw i eisiau afal ac oren, **ac mae** Sam eisiau banana.* - I want and apple and an orange, and Sam wants a banana.\n\n----\n####Or\nThe word for 'or' is *neu*:\n\n-  *afal neu oren* - an apple or an orange\n\nAlthough you have not met the soft mutation yet, for future reference, note that *neu* causes a soft mutation of a following noun, adjective or verb-noun.  It does not affect a verb.\n\n----\n####Saying \"yes\", \"no\", and \"thank you\"\n\nThe ways of answering 'yes' or 'no' in Welsh are quite varied .  In this unit we will practice:\n\n-  ***Ydw ***- Yes (I am/I do)\n-  ***Nac ydw*** - No (I'm not/I don't)\n\n(**Note** that the *Ydw* in these a verb related to *Dw i* (i am).  In very many forms of Welsh 'Yes/No' responses we are using a form of a verb instead of words specifically for 'yes' or 'no'.  There are specific yes/no words, but they are only used in particular circumstances.  This is not a straightforward thing to learn as a beginner, so the various yes/no responses are introduced gradually as they come up in the course for the first time.)\n\nIf you use the *isio* dialect form of *eisiau*, the answer yes/no is different - *Oes* (Yes); *Nac oes* (No)\n\n----\nPerhaps you might want some ice cream *(hufen iâ)*, and since you are polite, you will want to say 'thank you ' if someone offers it - *diolch* (thank you):\n\n-  *Dych chi eisiau hufen iâ?  Ydw.  Diolch* - \"Do you want an ice cream?  Yes.  Thank you.\n\nFor a simple 'No thanks' we have a different expression - *Dim diolch*:\n\n-  *Dych chi eisiau hufen iâ?  Dim diolch.* - Do you want an ice-cream?  No thanks.\n\n----\n#### The definite article - 'the'\n\nWhen saying **the** in Cymraeg, there are three forms used: ***'r, yr*** and ***y***.\n\nTo know which form to use, ***'r, yr*** or ***y***, just go through the sequence 1, 2, 3 below and use whichever one applies first.  Note that the *'r, yr, y* refers to the word following it in each case:\n\n1 -  ***'r*** is used following, and attached to, a word ending in a vowel (*a e i o u w y*, in Welsh), regardless of what letter the next word starts with. For example:\n\n-  *hoffi**'r** afal* - liking the apple [*...'r afal* = ...the apple]\n-  *casáu**'r** tywydd*\n-  *mynd i**'r** dre*\n\n2 -  ***yr*** is used before vowels and *h-*. For example: \n\n-  *maint **yr** afal*\n-  *blas **yr** oren*\n-  *yn ystod **yr** wythnos*\n\n3 - Otherwise, ***y*** is used.  For example:\n\n-  *gan **y** bachgen*\n-  *wrth **y** ferch*\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi**'r** car, **y** beic, **yr** awyren a**'r** eliffant.*\n\n**Note** - You will see *'y'* instead of *'yr'* used in front of some words beginning with *w-*.  Do not think that you have misunderstood the rules if you do come across it.  It tends to occur with feminine nouns beginning with *gw-*, especially *gwl-, gwn-, gwr-*, where the *-w-* has the quality of a consonant.  For example, *y wawr, y wers, y wraig, y wlad, y wrach*.\n\nIn the phrase *y llynedd* (last year), the *y* often resists changing to *'r* after a vowel.\n\n**Note** that *'r* is always written attached to the preceding word - this is not always obvious in Duolingo as its underlying display formatting rules sometimes separates them. \n\n----","urlName":"Wanting"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":48,"id":"30be3405ac7727503f7e83e6c8be874e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Colours","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Colours","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Colours\nColours, as with other adjectives, follow the noun in *Cymraeg*. For example:\n\n-  a blue bike => *beic glas*\n-  black coffee => *coffi du*\n-  a brown car => *car brown*\n\n----\nAs with other adjectives, colours undergo soft mutation after feminine singular nouns:\n\n-  *y ci du, y gath ddu* - the black dog, the black cat\n-  *y bwrdd coch, y gadair goch* - the red table, the red chair\n-  *ci gwyn, cath wyn* - a white dog, a white cat\n\n----\nWhere a colour is used with an adjective of size, the adjective of size comes before the colour:\n\n-  *car mawr gwyn* - a large white car\n-  *ci bach brown a gwyn* - a small brown and white dog\n\n----\n**Note** that if a feminine noun is followed by an unbroken chain of adjectives, they each take a soft mutation:\n\n-  *y gath **f**awr **w**yn* - the big white cat\n\nBut:\n\n-  *y gath **dd**u a gwyn* - the black and white cat (No mutation of *gwyn* as the chain of adjectives has been broken by *a* (and).)\n-  *y gath fawr ddu a gwyn* - the big black and white cat\n\n----\n####Soft mutation of feminine nouns after *y/'r* (the)\n\nLooking at the sentence above you will see that some nouns have mutated after *y*.  This is because *y/'r* causes a weak (+) soft mutation of feminine nouns\n\n((+)  In a 'weak' soft mutation, there is no mutation of words beginning with *ll-* or *rh-*)\n\n-  *pabell, y babell* - a tent, the tent\n-  *taten, y daten* - a potato, the potato\n-  *cath, y gath* - a cat, the cat\n-  *braich, y fraich* - an arm, the arm\n-  *derwen, y dderwen* - an oak-tree, the oak-tree\n-  *gwawr, y wawr* - a dawn, the dawn\n-  *merch, y ferch* - a girl, the girl\n-  *llaw, y llaw* - a hand, the hand (*llaw* is feminine)\n-  *rhaw, y rhaw* - a spade, the spade (*rhaw* is feminine)\n\nThere are no comprehensive rules as to which nouns are feminine, so it is best to look up and learn the genders at the same time that you learn the meanings.  As you go on you will begin to spot some patterns, but look out for the exceptions.\n\n----\n####Colour variations in Welsh\n\nThere are some other examples of occasional variations between the words for colours which you may come across:\n\n-  *Glas* (blue) is also sometimes used for shades of bluey-green and sometimes for the idea of 'fresh green', as in newly grown grass and plants.  *Glaswellt* is a word for 'grass'.  People who are inexperienced in things may also be described as *glas* or termed *gleision*, similar to the English 'green', 'greenhorn' and 'fresher'.\n\n-  *Melyn* (yellow) may be applied to shades of cream, beige or sandy colour.\n\n-  *Llwyd* (grey) may also be applied to some shades of grey-ish or dull brown.  For example, 'brown paper' used for wrapping is *papur llwyd*.\n\n----","urlName":"Colours"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":4,"id":"4470b7ba9a46f94b275b992ccf391cb0","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Work 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Work 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Stating your occupation\nThis unit introduces some nouns for work and occupations.  For example:\n\n-  *Actor dw i* - I am an actor\n-  *Actores dw i* - I am an actress\n-  *Ffermwr dw i* - I am a farmer\n-  *Siaradwr dw i* - I am a speaker\n\n**Note** that the name of the occupation comes first in the sentence.  This is the correct construction in Welsh when saying what job, occupation or role somebody has - just as when saying what someone's name is, as you learned earlier in the course:\n\n-  *Dewi dw i.  Ffermwr dw i.* - I'm Dewi.  I am a farmer. \n\n----\n####Asking what someone's name or job is\nWe use the same pattern to ask what someone's name or job is, but we use a rising tone towards the end of the question, as we usually do with questions in English.\n\nThe yes/no answering system can be quite complicated, but in this case it is very simple.  For a question that does not start with a verb, we simply use *Ie* (Yes) or *Nage* (No):\n\n-  *Athro dych chi?* - Are you a teacher?\n-  *John dych chi?* -  Are you John?\n-  *Nyrs dych chi?  Ie.* - Are you a nurse? Yes.\n-  *Athro dych chi? Nage, actor dw i.* - Are you a teacher?  No, I'm an actor.\n\n**Note** that on some areas you will hear *Naci* or other variations instead of *Nage* and *Ia* instead of *Ie*.  *Ia* and *Naci* are taught forms on *DysguCymraeg* 'north' courses.\n\n----\n####Names of occupations\nMany originally male-orientated occupations and nouns will end in *-wr* (from *gŵr* meaning 'a man'), such as *ffermwr*, and *siaradwr*, but these can be changed to a specifically female version of the same occupation by changing the *-wr* to *-wraig* (from *gwraig* meaning 'a woman'). For example:\n\n-  *Ffermwr* (a farmer) => *Ffermwraig* (specifically a female farmer)\n-  *Siaradwr* (a speaker) => *Siaradwraig* (specifically a female speaker)\n-  *Dysgwr* (a learner) => *Dysgwraig* (specifically a female learner)\n\nIn practice, though, the female versions are not always used.  The base version is also used as the non-gendered word, even though it remains a grammatically male noun.\n\nA few other occupations have their own specifically feminine versions, such as:\n\n-  *athro; athrawes* (a teacher).\n-  *ysgrifennydd; ysgrifenyddes* (a secretary)\n\nOthers make no distinction and can be used for either gender:\n\n-  *mecanic* - a mechanic\n-  *cyfrifydd* - an accountant\n-  *heddwas* - a police officer\n-  *meddyg, doctor* - a doctor\n-  *nyrs* - a nurse\n-  *peiriannydd* - an engineer\n\n----\n####Working somewhere\nTo say where we work, we use ***mewn*** or ***yn***, both meaning 'in' or sometimes 'at'.\n\nThe difference between *yn* and *mewn* is that *yn* is in a specific place, whilst *mewn* means in a non-specific place.  *Yn* is also used when saying 'in the...' (*yn y...*), in your..., in Cardiff, and so on.  (Note that when *yn* is used fot 'in/at' it does not contract to *'n* after a vowel):\n\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **yn** Abertawe* - I work **in** Swansea.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **yn y** theatr *yn* Abertawe* - I work **in the** theatre **in** Swansea.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **mewn** theatr **yn** Abertawe* - I work **in a** theatre **in** Swansea.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **yn** Tesco **yn** Abertawe* - I work **in** Tesco **in** Swansea (a specific shop in a named place)\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **mewn** siop* - I work **in a** shop.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **mewn** ysgol* - I work **in a** school.\n-  *Dw i'n gweithio **mewn** ysgol Gymraeg **yn** Abertawe* - I work **at a** Welsh-medium school **in** Swansea.\n\n----\n####'Welsh', 'Wales', 'Welsh language', 'Welsh-language'\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the various meanings of 'Welsh' and related words:\n\n-  *Cymraeg, y Gymraeg* - A noun meaning 'Welsh', 'the Welsh language'.\n-  *Cymraeg* - an adjective meaning 'Welsh-language' (books, programmes, etc), 'Welsh-speaking' (person) or, in education in particular, 'Welsh-medium' (that is, through the medium of the Welsh language).\n-  *Cymreig* - an adjective meaning 'Welsh' as in belonging to to or pertaining to Wales (rather than to the language).\n-  *Cymro (Cymry)* - a Welshman, a Welsh person  (Welshmen, Welsh people)\n-  *Cymraes (Cymraësau)* - a Welsh woman (Welsh women)\n-  *Cymru* - Wales \n-  *Cymreictod* - Welshness\n\n**Note** that some people will refer to 'Welsh school' when meaning 'Welsh-medium school'.  There is more information about Welsh-medium education here -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh-medium_education\n\nSimilarly:\n\n-  *Saesneg* - A noun meaning 'English', 'the English language'\n-  *Saesneg* - an adjective meaning 'English-language', 'English-speaking' or 'English-medium'.\n-   *Seisnig* - an adjective meaning 'English' as in belonging to to or pertaining to England (rather than to the language).\n-  *Sais (Saeson)* - an Englishman (Englishmen, English people)\n-  *Saesnes (Saesnesau)* - an Englishwoman (English women)\n-  *Lloegr* - England\n\n----","urlName":"Work-1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":26,"id":"a824eda516b4a8ddcae69ba97a845057","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Clothes 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Clothes 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces some terms relating to clothing.\n\n####Gender and plurals of Welsh nouns\nAs in many other languages, nouns in Welsh are either masculine or feminine in gender.  In Welsh, this affects how they are used in the language and in particular on how the initial letters in some words can change for various reasons.  This is called 'mutation'.\n\nThe mutations aren't introduced yet and you won't need to concern yourself with them until they gradually start to be introduced later in the course. Just for an example, notice how the first letters of these feminine words change after the word *y* (the):\n\n-  *cot, y **g**ot* - a coat, the coat\n-  *coban, y **g**oban* - a nightdress, the nightdress\n-  *baner, y **f**aner* - a flag, the flag\n-  *derwen, y **dd**erwen* - an oak tree, the oak tree\n-  *gwers, y wers* - a lesson, the lesson\n\n**Note** that plural nouns in Welsh have no gender - for example, these common articles of clothing have no gender:  *teits* (tights), *sanau* (socks), and *menig* (gloves). \n\n**Note** that there are several ways of forming plurals in Welsh and few guidelines about which method is used for a particular word.  A few words have more than one plural.  Like genders, plurals are best learned as you go.\n\nAny dictionary will show a noun's gender and its plural.\n\n----\nSome of the words for clothing introduced in this unit are (f - feminine, m - masculine, pl - plural):\n\n-  *siwmper* f - a jumper, pullover, sweater\n-  *het* f - a hat\n-  *ffrog* f - a dress/frock\n-  *cot, côt* f - a coat\n-  *coban* f - a nightdress\n-  *fest* f - a vest\n-  *cot law* f - a raincoat\n-  *crys* m - a shirt\n-  *gwregys* m - a belt\n-  *crys chwys* m - a sweatshirt\n-  *trowsus* m - (a pair of) trousers/pants\n-  *esgidiau* pl - shoes\n-  *menig* pl - gloves\n-  *sanau* pl - socks\n-  *jîns* pl - jeans\n\nYou will notice that several of these words in Modern Welsh are similar to their Modern English equivalents.  This is not surprising when you think that Welsh and English have developed as close neighbours for the past 1500 years or so.  Both of them draw on the Brythonic language of Britain which dates back to pre-Roman times, and both have been influenced by Latin from the time of the Romans in Britain onwards.  And of course several of the items of clothing themselves are relatively recent developments.\n\nBoth languages have many dialects (Welsh has perhaps five main dialects), and it is noticeable that several Welsh language patterns and words are found in the various English dialects of Wales.\n\nHowever, the structure of Modern Welsh is much closer to its Brythonic roots than Modern English is now, and this difference in structure and word order means that trying to translate word-for-word from one language to the other often does not work well at all.\n\nWelsh is not that difficult to learn once you realise that it is different!\n\n----\n####There is no 'a/an' in Welsh\n**Remember ** that there is no indefinite article 'a/an' in Welsh:\n\n-  *het* - 'hat' or 'a hat'\n-  *crys* - 'shirt' or 'a shirt'\n\nIn the following sentences, for example, 'a/an' is required to make sense in the English, even though there is no equivalent in the Welsh:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gwisgo cot law* - I am wearing a raincoat\n-  *Dw i eisiau sgarf* - I want a scarf\n\nSimilarly, with plurals we may use the word 'some' in the English translation where there is no equivalent in the Welsh:\n\n-  *Dw i eisiau jîns newydd* - I want some new jeans\n-  *Dw i'n gwisgo sanau* - 'I'm wearing socks' or 'I'm wearing some socks'\n\n----\n####Someone's things\n\nTo show that someone owns something we simply put the 'owner' after the thing 'owned':\n\n-  *crys Tom* - Tom's shirt\n-  *esgidiau Sioned* - Sioned's shoes\n\n----\n####Adjectives usually come after the noun\nWhen we are describing things, the adjective, the describing word, usually comes after the noun in Welsh:\n\n-  *cot **law*** - a **rain**coat\n-  *dillad **ysgol*** - **school** clothes\n-  *esgidiau **rhedeg*** - **running** shoes\n-  *jîns **newydd*** - **new** jeans\n\nAs in any language, there are always exceptions.  In Welsh there are about 10 adjectives which always come before the noun, and perhaps 20-25 which can come either before or after, creating slightly different meanings.  Only a very few of these will come up in this course.\n\n----","urlName":"Dillad1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":24,"id":"a792fc1ccf13104ab2c2fbe5bb981176","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Country 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Country 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This section introduces some names of countries, and how to say 'to', 'from' and 'in' places.

When it is used as a particle to link to verbs or to nouns and adjectives, it does get abbreviated:\n\n-  *Dw i **yn** Aber* - I am in Aber - no abbreviation\n-  *Dw i**'n** mynd* - I am going - abbreviation\n-  *Dw i**'n** hapus* - I am happy - abbreviation\n\n**Remember** that *yn* never causes soft mutation of words beginning with *ll-* or *rh-*, no matter what function it has in the sentence:\n\n-  *Dydy Siôn ddim **yn ll**on iawn **yn Ll**undain neu **yn Rh**os.* - Siôn is not very cheerful in London or in Rhos.\n\n----\n####**Nasal** mutations following *yn* when it is a preposition meaning 'in'\n\nWhen *yn* means 'in', **and only then**, it causes a **nasal** mutation of several letters (never a soft mutation) and can undergo changes itself.  \n\nHere is the nasal mutation - note the pattern where there is an *-h-* in the first three in the list, but no *-h-* in the second three:\n\n-  ***P-*** -> ***Mh-***\n-  ***T-*** -> ***Nh-***\n-  ***C-*** -> ***Ngh-***\n-  ***B-*** -> ***M-***\n-  ***D-*** -> ***N-***\n-  ***G-*** -> ***Ng-***\n\n**Only when it means 'in'**, *yn* changes to *ym* before *m-*, and to *yng* before *ng-*.

For that, we use *mynd at*.\n\n----\nBy putting **mynd i** in front of another verb-noun, it can be used to form a statement of someone's current intention to carry out a future action::\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i siarad â Dewi* - I am going to speak to Dewi.\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i godi.* - I am going to get up. *(codi)*\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i fynd i'r Eisteddfod.* - I'm going to go to the Eisteddfod. *(mynd)*\n-  *Dych chi'n mynd i ymweld â Sioned.* - You are going to visit Sioned.\n\n**Note** that *siarad* and *ymweld* are both followed by the preposition *â* (which becomes *ag* before a vowel).  LIke *mynd i*, this is an example of some verbs needing to be followed by particular prepositions in order to complete or modify their meaning.\n\n----\n####Soft mutation\n\nMutations are changes to some initial consonants of words in certain circumstances.  Only nine consonants can take a mutation at all, and not all of them take every mutation.  The previous paragraph has some examples of the most common mutation, the 'soft' mutation.\n\nThere are many causes of a soft mutation, only the most common of which are covered on this introductory course.  In this section, the preposition *i* (to, for) which causes soft mutation of the word that directly follows it.  For example, you will see above that *codi* has changed to *godi* following *mynd i*, and *mynd* to *fynd*.\n\nHere is a table showing the soft mutations:\n\n| original letter | soft mutation |\n|----|----|\n| *p-* | *b-* |\n| *t-* | *d-* |\n| *c-* | *g-* |\n| *b-* | *f-* |\n| *d-* | *dd-* |\n| *g-* | - |\n| *m-* | *f-* |\n| *ll-* | *l-* |\n| *rh*- | *r-* |\n\n**Remember** - *dd, ll* and *rh* are all single letters in Welsh (along with *ch, ff, ng, ph, th*).\n\n**Note** - when *g-* takes a soft mutation it vanishes, and that both *b-* and *m-* take a soft mutation to *f-*.\n\n----\n####Some prepositions are routinely followed by a soft mutation\nThey are:\n\n-  *am, ar, at, gan; dros, drwy, wrth, dan; heb, hyd, i, o.*\n\nSee - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjUdJqa5Hg\n\n----\n####Church and Chapel\nThe chapel movement was very strong in Wales.  As a result, \"chapel\" and \"church\" are not synonymous in Wales.  As influence of the established Church of England diminished, the non-conformist chapels became the primary location of Christian worship in many places.  In 1920, the Church of England was disestablished in Wales and the 'Church in Wales' was created as a separate Anglican body with no links to civil government.\n\n----\n####Going to the usual place\nWhen we are referring to places that we go to habitually, such as 'bed, 'chapel', 'work', 'school' etc, it is the convention in Welsh that *i'r...* ('to the...') is used.  English is not consistent in this:\n\n-  *Mae Siân yn mynd **i'r gwely*** - Siân is going **to bed**.\n-  *Dw i'n mynd **i'r capel** bob bore Sul.* - I go **to chapel** every Sunday morning.\n-  *Mae'r plant yn mynd **i'r ysgol**.* - The children are going **to school**.\n-  *Mae Mair yn mynd **i'r ymarfer côr** ar nos Lun*. - Mair goes **to choir practice** on Monday evenings.\n-  *Mae e'n mynd **i'r swyddfa**.* - He is going to **the office**.\n\n----\n####Doing things on particular days\nWhen we want to say that we are doing something 'on Monday', 'on Sunday' and so on, we usually simply change *dydd* to *ddydd* - there is no need to add anything else to mean 'on' in this case:\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i Aber ddydd Llun.* - I'm going to Aber **on Monday**.\n\nTo say 'on Mondays', etc, when we mean we do something habitually on a day, we use *ar* as well:\n\n-  *Mae'r plant yn mynd i nofio **ar nos Iau*** - the children go swimming **on Thursday evenings**\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i Aber **ar ddydd Llun*** - I go to Aber **on Mondays**\n\n----\n####Changes, or not, following question words\n\nThe adverbial questions *Pryd?, Pam?, Ble/Lle? and *Sut?* (when it means How?) are not followed by a soft mutation of the verb.  Nor are questions that begin with a preposition.  They are followed by *mae*, not by *ydy/yw*, and they are followed by *r-*forms of *bod*:\n\n-  *Pryd/Pam/Ble/Sut rwyt ti'n mynd?* - When/Why/Where/How are you going?\n\n(The *r-* is sometimes dropped in casual use, though...)\n\n----\n####Sports\nIn British English, when there is a well-known sporting event coming up it is usual for it to be referred to as simply 'the rugby', 'the golf', 'the athletics', etc:\n\n-  *Wyt ti'n mynd i wylio**'r** rygbi heno?* - Are you going to watch **the** rugby this evening?\n\n----","urlName":"Going-To"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"f90ac6c3cadd506b46834a9df4072cd6","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Past Mynd","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"PastMynd","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####The simple past tense of *mynd* (going, to go)\n\nThe **simple past** tense, for example:\n\n-  we went\n-  they went\n\nis not the same as the present perfect tense:\n\n-  we have gone\n-  Siân has gone\n\n####The simple past of the irregular verbs\n\n(The simple past of regular verbs is introduced later in the course.)\n\nThere are four main 'irregular' verbs - they do not follow the normal pattern in forming their tenses, although they do have patterns that are very similar to each other.  They are:\n\n-  **mynd** (going, to go), \n-  **dod** (coming, to come),\n-  **gwneud** (making, to make; doing, to do) and\n-  **cael** (getting, to get; having, to have). \n\nFor example, the forms for 'I' are formed as follows:\n\n-  *es i* - I went\n-  *des i* - I came\n-  *gwnes i* - I made; I did\n-  *ces i* - I got\n\n----\nAll of these verbs are followed by a soft mutation of their object, if they have one:\n\n-  *Ges i **f**recwast.* - I had breakfast.\n-  *Gwnes i **g**inio.* - I made dinner.\n\n----\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, *Mi* may be added in front of the verb, sometimes routinely, sometimes especially for emphasis.  It is only used with a positive statement, never with questions or negatives:\n\n-  *Mi es i* - I went\n-  *Mi est ti* - You went (informal singular 'you')\n-  *Mi aethoch chi* - You went (formal or plural 'you')\n\nIn other areas of Wales you may come across *Fe* being used instead of *Mi*, although this is perhaps less common nowadays.  *Fe* is not taught on this course.\n\n####Questions and Yes and No\n\nWe form the quesiton simply by adding a soft mutation at the start of the verb, a question mark at the end of the sentence in writing and by raising the tone at the end of the sentence when speaking:\n\n-  *Es i yno gyda ti?* - Did I go there with you?\n-  *Est ti i'r parti?* - Did you go to the party?\n-  *Aethoch chi i Aber?* - Did you go to Aber?\n\nIn the simple past tense there is only one form of **Yes** and one form of **No**\n\n**Do** = *Yes*         \n**Naddo** = *No*\n\n-  *Aethoch chi yno ddoe?  Do.* - Did you go there yesterday?  Yes.\n-  *Aeth e i Aber gyda/efo Siôn?  Naddo, roedd hi'n rhy oer.* - Did he go to Aber with Siôn?  No, it was too cold.\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nA negative verb will take a mixed mutation - an aspirate mutation of *p, t, c* and a soft mutation of the other mutatable consonants.\n\nIn the case of teh past of *mynd*, simply add *ddim* for a negative - the none of the past tense forms of *mynd* start with a consonant.  For example:\n\n-  *es i ddim* - I did not go\n-  *est ti ddim* - you did not go\n-  *Aeth Siân ddim i Aber* - Siân did not go to Aber\n-  *Aethon ni ddim yno* - We didn't go there\n\n----\n####The full simple past conjugations of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael*\nFor reference, the full pattern of the simple past tense of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael* in the general colloquial language is as follows, starting with *mynd*:\n\n-  *es i*\n-  *est ti*\n-  *aeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *aethon ni*\n-  *aethoch chi*\n-  *aethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *dod*:\n\n-  *des i*\n-  *dest ti*\n-  *daeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *daethon ni*\n-  *daethoch chi*\n-  *daethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *gwneud* (note that the initial *g-* is sometimes dropped in the colloquial language, and that if that happens the *-w-* is often not pronounced either):\n\n-  *gwnes i*\n-  *gwnest ti*\n-  *gwnaeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *gwnaethon ni*\n-  *gwnaethoch chi*\n-  *gwnaethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *cael* (note that these forms are often seen with the mutation *c- -> g-* in the colloquial language):\n\n-  *Ces i*\n-  *Cest ti*\n-  *Caeth/Cafodd e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson ni*\n-  *Caethoch/Cawsoch chi*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson nhw*\n\n----\n**Note** that in parts of mid- and north Wales these are often used and taught with a preceding particle *mi* and a soft mutation.  For example: *mi **g**aethon nhw*.\n\nYou may well meet some variations in the patterns of these four irregular verbs, especially in informal speech and in the various dialects.  \n\n----\n####On Monday, On Tuesday, etc\n\nTo say that we did something on a day we mutate the word *dydd* to *ddydd* (although this is not always done in casual Welsh):\n\n-  *Aethon ni i Aber ddydd Sadwrn* - We went to Aber on Saturday\n-  *Aeth hi ddydd Sul* - She went on Sunday.\n\n**Note** that we do not use *ar* for this - strictly, *ar ddydd Sul* means 'on Sundays', not 'on Sunday'.\n\n**Note** that we do use *ar* with a particular date:\n\n-  *Aeth o yno ar y pedwerydd o Fai.* - He went there on the fourth of May.\n\n----","urlName":"Past-Mynd"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":24,"id":"2208a15fae76370deeeeb38fdbe70578","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Past Gwneud","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"P Gwneud","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####The simple past of *gwneud*\n\n*Gwneud* is another of the common irregular verbs in Welsh, and its simple past tense follows the same pattern as the others.\n\n####I made, You made\n\n-  *Gwnes i* - I made/did\n-  *Gwnest ti* - You made/did (singular informal 'you')\n-  *Gwnaeth e/hi* - He/She made/did\n-  *Gwnaeth Siân/y plant* - Siân/The children made/did\n-  *Gwnaethon ni* - We made/did\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi* - You made/did (formal or plural 'you')\n-  *Gwnaethon nhw* - They made/did\n\n----\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, *Mi* may be added in front of the verb, especially for emphasis.

Do.* - Did they make the coffee?  Yes.\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nSimply use the mixed mutation (soft in the case of *gwneud*) with *ddim* for a negative:\n\n-  *Wnes i ddim swper neithiwr.* - I didn't make any supper yesterday evening.\n-  *Wnaethoch chi ddim dillad newydd.* - You didn't make any new clothes.\n\n----\n####The full simple past conjugations of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael*\nFor reference, the full pattern of the simple past tense of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael* in the general colloquial language is as follows, starting with *mynd*:\n\n-  *Es i*\n-  *Est ti*\n-  *Aeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Aethon ni*\n-  *Aethoch chi*\n-  *Aethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *dod*:\n\n-  *Des i*\n-  *Dest ti*\n-  *Daeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Daethon ni*\n-  *Daethoch chi*\n-  *Daethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *gwneud* (note that the initial *g-* is sometimes dropped in the colloquial language, and that if that happens the *-w-* is often not pronounced either):\n\n-  *Gwnes i*\n-  *Gwnest ti*\n-  *Gwnaeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Gwnaethon ni*\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi*\n-  *Gwnaethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *cael* (note that these forms are often seen with the mutation *c- -> g-* in the colloquial language):\n\n-  *Ces i*\n-  *Cest ti*\n-  *Caeth/Cafodd e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson ni*\n-  *Caethoch/Cawsoch chi*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson nhw*\n\n----\n**Note** that in parts of Mid- and north Wales these are often used and taught with a preceding particle *mi* and a soft mutation.

This method is widely used all over Wales, especially in conversation.\n\n**Remember** that the object of a short-form verb takes a soft mutation.  In this case, the object of *gwneud* is the verb-noun for which we are creating the simple past tense.  Using the example of *canu*:\n\n-  *Gwnes i **g**anu* - I sang\n-  *Gwnest ti ganu* - You sang\n-  *Gwnaeth e/hi/Siân/y plant ganu* - He/she/Siân/the children sang\n-  *Gwnaethon ni ganu* - We sang\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi ganu* - You sang\n-  *Gwnaethon nhw ganu* - They sang\n\nThe initial *g-* is often dropped in speech and the remaining *w-* may only be lightly pronounced, if at all.\n\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, the particle *mi* is often added at the start of the phrase.  *Mi* causes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Mi wnes i ganu* - I sang, I did sing\n-  *Mi wnaeth o ganu* - he sang\n-  *Mi wnaeth Siân ganu* - Siân sang\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Gwnes i siarad â Sian* - I spoke to Siân\n-  *Mi wnes i gerdded efo Siôn* - I walked with Siôn\n-  *Mi wnaeth y gath ladd yr aderyn.* - The cat killed the bird.\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi brynu llyfr ddoe.* - You bought a book yesterday.\n-  *Gwnest ti ddarllen y llyfrau ddoe.* - You read the books yesterday.\n\n----\n####Questions\n\nAs with the past of *gwneud* earlier in the course, just use the soft mutated form of *gwnes i, etc* and raise the tone at the end of the question:\n\n-  *Wnes i siarad â Sian?* - Did I speak to Siân?\n-  *Wnest ti gerdded gyda/efo Siôn?* - Did you walk with Siôn?\n-  *Wnaeth o weld cathod yno?* - Did he see any cats there? \n-  *Wnaethoch chi ddarllen llyfrau ddoe* - Did you read any books yesterday?\n\n**Remember** that *Fe/Mi* is never used with a question.\n\n----\nThe answers to any question in the simple past are the same:\n\n-  *do* - yes\n-  *naddo* - no\n\n-  *Wnaethoch chi ddarllen y nofel 'na?  Do.* - Did you read that novel?  Yes (I/we did).\n-  *Wnaethon nhw nofio yn môr ddoe?  Naddo, roedd y dŵr yn rhy oer.* - Did they swim in the sea yesterday?  No, the water was too cold.\n\n----\n####Negatives\nAs with other negatives, we mutate the verb (soft mutation in the case of *gwneud*) and add ***ddim***.  The *ddim* takes the soft mutation as the start of the object of the *gwneud* verb, so we do not mutate the verb-noun which follows it:\n\n-  *Wnes i ddim siarad â Sian* - I didn't speak to Siân\n-  *Wnes i ddim cerdded gyda/efo Siôn* - I did not walk with Siôn. (no mutation of *cerdded*)\n-  *Wnaethoch chi ddim darllen llyfrau ddoe* - You did not read any books yesterday. (no mutation of *darllen*)\n\n----","urlName":"Auxiliary-Past-Gwneud"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":22,"id":"60587829461c5ef2bae9e49ddb054a62","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Numbers 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Numbers 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"There are two counting systems in Cymraeg: the **decimal** and **vigesimal** systems. \n\nIn this section you will learn the modern **decimal** system that is based on **tens**.

For example:\n\n-  *Pedwar deg chwech* - Forty-six (literally 'four ten(s),  six')\n\n----\n####Singular nouns follow numbers\n**Note** that in Welsh the **singular noun** is used after a number, not the plural. For example:\n\n-  *Dau **oren***  - Two oranges (not * *dau orenau*)\n-  *Un deg pum **afal*** - fifteen apples (not * *un deg pum afalau*)\n-  *Tri **afa**l* - Three apples (not * *tri afalau*)\n-  *Pum deg tri **oren*** - Fifty-three oranges (not * *pum deg tri orenau*)\n\n---\n####Changes in *pump, chwech, cant* when followed by adjectives or nouns\n\n*pump, chwech* and *cant* drop their final letters *(-p, -ch, -t)* when they come before the nouns and adjectives that they are numbering:\n\n-  *pum car* - five cars\n-  *chwe beic* - six bikes\n-  *can person* - *a hundred people*\n\n----\n####Different forms of *dau, tri, pedwar* used with feminine nouns\nAlthough it is not practised in this section, you may come across some other forms of 2, 3 and 4 which are always used with feminine nouns.  Here, *athro* (teacher) is masculine and *athrawes* is specifically a female teacher:\n\n-  *dau athro, dwy athrawes*\n-  *tri athro, tair athrawes*\n-  *pedwar athro, pedair athrawes*\n\n----\n####Using *dau* and *dwy* after *'r/yr/y*\n\n*dau* and *dwy* change after the definite article:\n\n-  *y **dd**au eliffant* - the two elephants\n-   *y **dd**wy arth* - the two bears\n\nThis type of change is called a 'soft mutation', and it is covered in more detail later in the course.\n\n----\n####Mutations after *un, dau/dwy, tri, chwe*:\n\n-  Feminine nouns take a weak soft mutation after *un* (soft mutation, but no mutation of *ll-, rh-*).\n-  *dau* and *dwy* both cause a soft mutation of following words.\n-  *tri, chwe* cause an aspirate mutation of following words - *p-, t-, c-* are mutated to *ph-, th-, ch-* respectively.  Note that the feminine forms *tair, pedair* do not cause a mutation.\n\nSo ((b) = feminine noun):\n\n-  *merch (b), un ferch, dwy ferch, tair merch, chwe merch* - a girl, one girl, two girls, three girls, six girls\n-  *rhaw (b), un rhaw, dwy **r**aw, tair rhaw, chwe rhaw* - a spade, one spade, two spades, three spades, six spades\n-  *teisen (b), un **d**eisen, dwy **d**eisen, tair teisen, chwe **th**eisen* - a cake, one cake, two cakes, three cakes, six cakes\n-  *twll, un twll, dau **d**wll, tri **th**wll, chwe **th**wll* - a hole, one hole, three holes, six holes\n-  *pêl (b), un bêl, dwy bêl, tair pêl, chwe phêl* - a ball, one ball, two balls, three balls, six balls\n-  *pen, un pen, dau ben, tri phen, chwe phen* - a head, one head, two heads, three heads, six heads\n\n**Note** that feminine forms of numbers are also used with age:\n\n-  *Mae Siân yn ddwy (flwydd) oed.* - -Siân is two years old.

English is not so consistent:\n\n-  *yn **yr** ysgol* - at school\n-  *yn **y** swyddfa* - at **the** office\n-  *Maen nhw yn yr ysgol heddiw.* - They are at school today.\n-  *Mae hi yn y swyddfa.* - She is at the office.\n\n----\n####Hyphens in numbers in English\n\nNormal English usage is to put a hyphen between two-part numbers - twenty-five, thirty-one, ninety-nine, etc.  This avoids confusion between expressions such as 'thirty four-part complete kits' and 'thirty-four part-complete kits'.\n\n----\n####Britishisms -'sums'\n\nIn British English, the word 'sums' is often used to refer to the sort of basic arithmetic taught to children in primary schools - simple addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, etc.  So:\n\n-  *symiau* - sums, arithmetic\n-  *rhifyddeg* - arithmetic\n-  *mathemateg* - mathematics, maths, math\n\n----","urlName":"Numbers-1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":14,"id":"ad536dba9d2c8944b14c172635b1fd95","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Weather","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Weather","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Describing the weather\n\n**Note** that for an abstract 'it', such as when referring to time, distance or weather, we use the pronoun *hi*.\n\nWe use the construction ***Mae hi'n...*** (it is) with an adjective.  **Note** that *'n/yn* here causes a weak soft mutation of the adjective.

For example:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n braf y bore 'ma.* - It's fine this morning.\n-  *Bydd hi'n wlyb prynhawn 'ma.* - It'll be wet this afternoon.\n\nFor 'that' we can use, similarly, *'na*:\n\n-  *Roedd hi'n wyntog y prynhawn 'na.* - It was windy that afternoon.\n-  *Roedd hi'n oer iawn bore 'na.* - It was very cold that morning.\n\n----\nThere are words (adverbs) for some other particular times:\n\n-  *echdoe* - the day before yesterday\n-  *echnos* - the night/evening before last\n-  *ddoe* - yesterday\n-  *neithiwr* - yesterday evening; last night\n-  *heddiw* - today\n-  *heno* - this evening; tonight\n-  *yfory* - tomorrow\n\nAnd we can combine some of them:\n\n-  *bore ddoe* - yesterday morning\n-  *prynhawn ddoe* - yesterday afternoon\n-  *bore yfory* - tomorrow morning\n-  *prynhawn yfory* - tomorrow afternoon\n-  *nos yfory* - tomorrow evening/night\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Roedd y tywydd yn ofnadwy echdoe.* - The weather was terrible the day before last.\n-  *Erbyn nos yfory, bydd hi'n wyntog iawn.* - By tomorrow evening, it will be very windy.\n-  *Sut bydd y tywydd prynhawn yfory?* - What will the weather be like tomorrow afternoon?\n-  *Sut roedd y tywydd bore echdoe?* - What was the weather like the morning before last?\n\n----\n####Soft mutations after *nos* in days of the week\n\nNow that you have met the soft mutation a couple of times you can use it following *nos* with the days of the week where we did not cover them earlier in the course:\n\n-  *dydd Llun, (nos + **Ll**un ->) nos **L**un* - Monday evening/night\n-  *dydd Mawrth, nos **F**awrth* - Tuesday evening/night\n-  *dydd Mercher, nos **F**ercher* - Wednesday evening/night\n-  *dydd Gwener, nos **W**ener* - Friday evening/night\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Erbyn nos Fercher bydd hi'n oer iawn* - By Wednesday evening it will be very cold.\n\n----\n####Too hot, too windy\nTo say 'too' in this context we use an adverb *rhy*.  It causes soft mutation of the following word:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n rhy **b**oeth.* - It's too hot. *(poeth)*\n-  *Roedd hi'n rhy **w**yntog ddoe.* - it was too windy yesterday. *(gwyntog)*\n-  *Bydd hi'n rhy **w**lyb i fynd allan heno.* - It'll be too wet to go out this evening. *(gwlyb)*\n-  *Mae hi'n rhy oer.* - It's too cold.\n\n**Note** that *rhy* is not mutated by *yn* - the letters *ll-* and *rh-* resist mutation by *yn*.\n\n----\n####*yn* again\n**Note** that the *'n* in the notes above is a shortened form of *yn* - this use of *yn/'n*, though, is not quite the same as the one which we have seen before getting to this section. This use of *yn* links to an adjective (cold, wet, stormy, red, fast) rather than linking to a verb-noun (going, swimming, buying, getting):\n\n-  If *yn/'n* is linking to a verb-noun, there is no mutation.\n-  If *yn/'n* is linking to an adjective or an adverb, there is a weak soft mutation (no mutation of *ll-* or *rh-*).\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n **d**arllen.* - She is reading. - no mutation\n-  *Mae hi'n **dd**iflas.* - It is miserable. - soft mutation *diflas -> ddiflas*\n-  *Mae'r llyfr yn **dd**a.* - The book is good. - soft mutation *da -> dda*\n\nThis will be covered again later in the course, too, so don't worry if it isn't absolutely clear yet.\n\n----","urlName":"Weather"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"f8601781fe0426d1cee14b61289c4297","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Months","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Months","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"These lessons introduce the names of the months and the seasons.\n\n----\n**Please remember** that there are occasional known glitches in the computer-generated voice - unfortunately the course team can do nothing about this, so please do not report audio faults.\n\n----\n####The Months\n\nSome of the names of the months in Welsh are borrowed from Latin, eg May = Maius (Latin) => *Mai* (Welsh)\n\n----\nThe word ***mis*** (month) precedes the name of the month, and the name of the month always starts with a capital letter:\n\n-  *mis Ebrill* - April\n-  *mis Mai* - May\n-  *mis Gorffennaf* - July\n\nTo say **in** a particular month we add the word ***ym***\n\n-  *ym mis Ebrill* - in April\n-  *ym mis Mehefin* - in June\n\n**Note** that using the word *mis* in front of the names of the months is important, as the names of some of the months also mean other things in Welsh.  For example:\n\n-  *Mawrth* - Mars, the planet\n-  *dydd Mawrth* - Tuesday\n-  *mis Mawrth* - March\n-  *medi* - harvesting, to harvest\n-  *mis Medi* - September\n-  *yr hydref* - autumn\n-  *mis Hydref* - October\n\nThe *mis* is sometimes dropped when the context is very clear or when used with dates (covered later in the course).  Apart from when using dates, it is best to use the *mis*, and this is what Duo does.\n\n**Note** that the names of the months are all masculine in gender.  The word *mis* itself is also masculine.\n\n----\n####The Seasons\n\n**Note** that the names of the seasons do not usually start with a capital letter unless they are part of the title of something or, of course, if they are used at the start of a sentence.\n\nThe seasons are usually used with *y/yr*:\n\n-  *y gwanwyn* - spring\n-  *yr haf* - summer\n-  *yr hydref* - autumn (fall)\n-  *y gaeaf* - winter\n\n**Note** that the names of the seasons are all masculine in gender.\n\nTo say 'in autumn' or 'in the autumn', etc, we use *yn y ...*:\n\n-  *yn yr hydref* - in autumn, in the autumn\n-  *yn y gaeaf* - in winter, in the winter\n\n----\n**Be careful** to spell *gwanwyn* correctly, as there are some very similar-looking words:\n\n-  *y gwanwyn* - spring\n-  *gwenwyn* - poison\n-  *gwenyn, gwenynen* - bees, a bee\n\n----\n####Seeing or enjoying, etc, something doing something\nWe can say that we see or enjoy, etc, something **in the process of doing something** by using *'n/yn* in front of the 'doing something':\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi gweld y ci**'n** chwarae.* - I like seeing the dog **playing**.\n-  *Dych chi'n mwynhau gwylio'r plant **yn** peintio?* - Do you enjoy watching the children painting?\n-  *Dw i ddim yn hoffi clywed y ci'n cyfarth!* - I do not like hearing the dog barking!\n\n----\n####How to remember the genders of the main units of time\n\nBoth *eiliad* (a second) and *munud* (a minute) can be either masculine or feminine, sometimes varying by dialect.  However, if we ignore that for the sake of an aid to memory, there is a useful pattern to be seen in the alternating genders of units of time.  (Here, *b* is *benywaidd* (feminine) and *g* is *gwrywaidd* (masculine)):\n\n-  *eiliad (b)* - a second\n-  *munud (g)* - a minute\n-  *awr (b)* - an hour\n-  *dydd, diwrnod (g)* - day, a day\n-  *wythnos (b)* - a week\n-  *mis (g)* - a month\n-  *blwyddyn (b); [blwydd (b)]* - a year; [a year of age]\n-  *degaid, degawd (g)* - a decade\n-  *canrif (b)* - a century\n-  *mileniwm (g)* - a millennium\n\nSo, if you can remember the gender of one, you can work out the others.\n\n----\n####Pronunciation reminder\n\nHave you checked and practised your pronunciation recently?

Note that the spoken form is often shortened for some forms compared to the longer (written) form.\n\n|      English    |       Welsh   | Sentence | \n| -------------- | -------------- |-------------- |\n|    I was  |Ro'n (Roeddwn) i| Ro'n i'n hapus.|\n|   You were  | Ro't (Roeddet) ti | Ro't ti'n hapus.|\n|   He was  |Roedd e/o | Roedd o'n hapus.|\n|   She was  |Roedd hi | Roedd hi'n hapus.|\n|  We were  |Ro'n (Roedden) ni| Ro'n ni'n hapus.|\n|  You were  |Ro'ch (Roeddech) chi | Ro'ch chi'n hapus.|\n|  They were  |Ro'n (Roedden) nhw | Ro'n nhw'n hapus.|\n\n----\n####Questions\n\nThe question is formed by dropping the initial *r*:\n\n-  *O't ti yno?*  - Were you there?\n-  *Oeddech chi yn y neuadd?* - Were you in the hall?\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nThe negative is formed by replacing the initial *r* with a *d*:\n\n-  *Do't ti ddim yno.* - You were not there.\n-  *Doedd Siôn ddim yn y siop.* - Siôn was not in the shop.\n\n----\n####Yes and No\n\n'Yes' and 'No' are formed from the question, dropping the pronoun for the affirmative and adding *Nac* for the negation:\n\n -  *O'ch chi ar y bws ddoe? O'n.* - Were you on the bus yesterday? Yes (I was) or Yes (we were).\n-  *O'ch chi ar y bws ddoe? Nac o'n.* - Were you on the bus yesterday? No.\n-  *Oedd Dewi yn yr ysgol ddoe?  Nac oedd.* - Was Dewi at school yesterday?  No.\n\n----\n####Using *arfer*\n\nThe verb-noun *arfer* (being used to) can be used with the imperfect to mean that somebody used to do something habitually.  It is not actually needed in Welsh to convey that meaning, but if it is used in Welsh is should always be translated into English as 'used to':\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n nofio bob dydd.* => I swam every day; I used to swim every day.\n-  *Ro'n i'n **arfer** nofio bob dydd.* => I **used to** swim every day.\n-  *Roedd hi'n chwarae pêl-droed ar ddydd Sadwrn.* - She played football on Saturdays; She used to play football on Saturdays.\n-  *Roedd hi'n **arfer** chwarae pêl-droed ar ddydd Sadwrn.* - She **used to** play football on Saturdays.\n\n----\n####Emphatic sentences in the imperfect\n\nEarlier in the course, emphatic sentences were introduced for describing someone's name, job, role, and so on, with *yw/ydy* following after the thing being emphasised.  In the unemphatic sentence, the verb starts the sentence (*mae* here):\n\n-  *Mae e'n gweithio fel canwr* - He works as a singer. (unemphatic)\n-  *Canwr **ydy** e.* - He is a singer.  (emphasising 'singer')\n\nIn the imperfect, there is also a difference in the verb-forms used, but it is less obvious:\n\n-  *Roedd e'n gweithio fel canwr* - He used to work as a singer.  (unemphatic, using *r-* form)\n-  *Canwr **oedd** e.* - He used to be a singer.  (emphatic, *r-* has been dropped)\n\n----\n\n####*pan* - when (conjunction)\n\nThe word *pan* is used for 'when' when it is a conjunction joining two phrases or when introducing a time when something happened::\n\n-  I liked Aber **when** I lived there.\n-  **When** I was at school I used to enjoy maths.\n\n*pan* causes a soft mutation of an immediately following word, or the dropping of *r-* from forms of *bod*:\n\n-  *Pan **b**rynais i'r car, roedd e'n rhad iawn.* - When I bought the car, it was very cheap.  *(prynais => brynais)*\n-  *Ro'n i'n mwynhau darllen nofel pan **g**anodd y ffôn* - I was enjoying reading a novel when the phone rang. *(canodd => ganodd)*\n-  *Pan **o**'n i'n rhedeg, ro'n i'n gyflym iawn.* - When I used to run, I was very fast.  *(ro'n => o'n)*\n\n----","urlName":"Imperfect"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":63,"id":"e270bd10f6835303a642846a5fcb02ac","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Revise and Extend 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"RevEx 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"The aim of this section is to revise patterns already covered, to extend their application, and to introduce additional vocabulary.\n\n----\n####Hungry and thirsty\n\nIn Welsh the idea of being hungry or thirsty\n is expressed by 'a want' of 'food/drink' using the word *eisiau* (a want) in along with *bwyd/diod* (food/drink):\n\n-  *Dych chi **eisiau bwyd**.* - You are **hungry**.\n-  *Dw i **eisiau diod**.* - I am **thirsty**.\n\n----\n####A reminder of the full present tense of *bod* (to be)\n\nHere is the full pattern of the present tense of *bod* - *dw i*, etc, again:\n\n|      Positive    |       Question   | Negative | Translation |\n| -------------- | -------------- |-------------- |-------- |\n|         *[ry)dw i*    | *(y)dw i*?          |  *(dy)dw i ddim*|  I am, Am I?, I am not|\n|           *rwyt ti*    |      *wyt ti?*        | *dwyt ti ddim*| You (sing) are.. etc.|\n|        *mae e/o*     |      *ydy e/o?*         | *dydy e/o ddim* | He is....etc. | \n|        *mae hi*      |      *ydy hi?*         | *dydy hi ddim* | She is....etc. | \n|     *(ry)dyn ni*    |      *ydyn ni?*  | *(dy)dyn ni ddim* | We are.... etc.| \n|     *(ry)dych chi*    |      *(y)dych chi?*   | *(dy)dych chi ddim* | You (pl) are.... etc.| \n|         *maen nhw*      |      *ydyn nhw?*         | *(dy)dyn nhw ddim* | They are....etc |\n\n*(ry)dw i* shows the full written form in brackets (*rydw i*) compared to the spoken form taught on this course (*dw i*).\n\n**Remember** that *mae* is also used with nouns, both singular **and plural**:\n\n-  *Mae'r dyn yn mynd adre.* - The man is going home.\n-  *Mae'r dynion yn mynd adre.* - The men are going home\n-  *Mae'r plant yn mynd adre.* - The children are going home.\n-  *Mae Siôn a Siân yn mynd adre.* - Siôn and Siân are going home.\n\n----\n####Home, at home, to home\n\nThere are three words to learn concerning home:\n\n-  *cartre* - a home\n-  *gartre* - at home\n-  *adre* - (towards) home, home(wards) - used to convey some sort of movement towards or arrival at home.\n\nAll three will also be seen with a final *-f*, although it is rarely pronounced in colloquual Welsh.\n\n-  *Mae **cartre** Dewi yn Aber.* - Dewi's **home** is in Aber.\n-  *Mae Dewi yn aros **gartre** heddiw.* - Dewi is staying **at home** today.\n-  *Mae Sioned yn **cerdded adre**.* - Sioned is **walking home**.\n-  *Mae Sioned yn cyrraedd adref erbyn saith o'r gloch fel arfer.* - Sioned usually gets home by seven o'clock.\n\n----\n\n####Newydd - has/have just\n\nEarlier in the course you met the use of *wedi* to say htat you 'have done' something:\n\n-  *Dw i wedi cyrraedd yr ysgol* - I have arrived at school.\n\nTo say that we have just done something, we can simply replace the *wedi* with *newydd* followed by a soft mutation of the verb-noun:\n\n-  *Dw i newydd **g**yrraedd yr ysgol.* - I have just arrived at school.\n-  *Dw i newydd **b**rynu beic.* - I have just bought a bike.\n-  *Ydy Dewi newydd **dd**od adre?* - Has Dewi just come home?\n-  *Ydy Mair yn mynd allan heno?  Ydy, mae hi newydd ymadael* - Is Mair going out this evening?  Yes, she has just left.\n\n----\n####Aspirate mutation\n\nWelsh has a system of 'initial consonant mutations' that a re applied to words in certain patterns. An aspirate mutation only applies to three initial consonants - *p, t* and *c*.  They each change to a different letter:\n\n-  *p => ph*\n-  *t => th*\n-  *c => ch*\n\nThe aspirate mutation follows:\n\n-  the numbers *tri* and *chwech*\n-  the prepositions *a, â, gyda* and *tua*\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *tri **ch**rys a **ph**edair sgert* - three shirts and four skirts\n-  *Dw i'n gwisgo'r sgert goch gyda **ch**rys glas.* - I am wearing the red skirt with a blue shirt.\n\nIt is also applied to negative verbs beginning with *p, t* and *c*.  That is practised later in the course.\n\nSome other words and patterns also cause an aspirate mutation, and some of those are introduced later in the course.\n\n\n----","urlName":"RevEx-1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":44,"id":"199a18f10cb9a7533978c6b692f94eb5","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":6,"levels":6,"name":"Animals 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Animals","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit covers the names of some common animals and revises numbers\n\n----\n**Remember** - *pump, chwech* and *cant* (100) drop their final letters *(-p, -ch, -t)* before nouns.\n\nExamples:\n\n-  *pum afal, chwe oren, can tŷ* - five apples, six oranges, a hundred houses\n\n----\n**Remember** that 2, 3 and 4 have feminine forms used in front of feminine nouns.  \n\n----\n**Note** some additional points about numbers:\n\n-  *un* is followed by a weak soft mutation of feminine nouns (no mutation of *rh-* or *ll-*)\n-  *dau/dwy* is followed by a soft mutation\n-  *tri* is followed by an aspirate mutation\n-  *chwe* is followed by an aspirate mutation\n\nExamples:\n\n-  *un ci; un **g**ath; un llygoden; un rhywogaeth* - one dog, one cat; one mouse; one species (*llygoden* and *rhywogaeth* are feminine nouns but not affected by the weak soft mutation)\n-  *dau **g**i; dwy **g**ath* - two dogs; two cats\n-  *tri **ch**i; tair cath* - three dogs; three cats\n-  *pedwar ci; pedair cath* - four dogs; four cats\n-  *chwe **ch**i; chwe **ch**ath* - six dogs; six cats\n\n----\n**Note** - Both *dau* and *dwy* take a soft mutation after *'r/y* (the):\n\n-  *y ddau gi; y ddwy gath* - the two dogs; the two cats\n\n----\n####Soft mutation of feminine nouns and adjectives\n Many names of animals *(anifeiliaid)* end in *-en*. Most nouns that end in *-en* in *Cymraeg* are feminine and will therefore take a weak soft mutation after *'r/y* (the).  \n\n**Remember** that in a weak soft mutation the letters *ll-* and *rh-* resist the mutation.\n\nAdjectives following feminine nouns take a soft mutation. Remember that the adjective usually follows the noun. For example:\n\n-  *y llygoden **f**awr* - the big mouse *(mawr)*\n-  *y ddafad **f**ach* - the small sheep *(bach)*\n-  *yr arth **g**yflym* - the fast bear *(cyflym)*\n\n[**Note** that there are a very few exceptions to this  rule.  These include the phrases - *Nos da* (Good night) and *wythnos diwethaf* (last week), where *nos* and *wythnos* are both feminine nouns but where the following *d-* is not mutated.]\n\n**Note** that the mutation also applies to more than one following adjective in an unbroken sequence:\n\n-  *yr arth **f**awr **g**yflym* - the big fast bear\n-  *yr arth **f**awr **f**rown **g**yflym* - the big fast brown bear\n\n----\n####Singular nouns used with numbers\n**Remember** that in *Cymraeg*, the singular noun is used when follows directly after a number. For example:\n\n-  *saith neidr* - seven snakes (not the plural *nadroedd*)\n-  *pedwar ci* - four dogs (not *cŵn*)\n-  *wyth ceffyl* - eight horses (not *cefyllau*)\n\n----\n####Aspirate mutation following *tri* and *chwe*\n**Remember** that nouns following *tri, chwe* take an aspirate mutation if they begin with *p-, t-, c-*:\n\n-  *tri **ph**anda* - three pandas *(panda)*\n-  *chwe **th**eigr* - six tigers *(teigr)*\n-  *tri **ch**ranc* - three crabs *(cranc)*\n\n----\n####Numbers + *o* + plural noun\nYou may also meet ***...o...*** (of) with a number and the plural noun, especially with larger numbers, although this is generally not used in the course. This also requires a soft mutation following the *o*, as well as a knowledge of the plural form of nouns. For example:\n\n-   *dau ddeg **o** nadroedd* - twenty snakes\n-   *deg **o g**ŵn* - ten dogs\n-   *cant **o g**effylau* - a hundred horses\n\n----","urlName":"Animals-1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":11,"id":"4705b909d7d539923bc96f9f74e0ea1a","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Places1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Places 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"When using Welsh in Wales you will come across place names which you may only have heard before in English.

Where a place has a different name in both languages, though, we do translate them.\n\n#### The Soft Mutation following *i* (to) and *o* (from) \nYou may have heard of mutations in the Welsh language.  In this unit we introduce the first, and by far the most common of these - the soft mutation.\n\nThe prepositions *i* (to) and *o* (from) cause a soft mutation of the following word.  This means that some consonants at the start of words 'soften'.  Here is the complete list:\n\n|  Original letter |  Soft mutated letter  |\n| --------- | --------- |\n|   *p*  |  *b*  |\n|   *t*   | *d* |\n|   *c*   | *g* |\n|    *b*  |  *f* |\n|  *d* | *dd*  |\n|   *g*  | *-* |\n|    *m* | *f* |\n|   *ll* | *l* |\n|   *rh*  | *r* |\n\n(**Note** - the *g* vanishes when it undergoes soft mutation)\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i **D**ywyn.* - I am going to **T**ywyn. *(t => d)*\n-  *Dw i'n dod o **L**anelli.* - I come from **Ll**anelli. *(ll => l)*\n-  *Mae o'n dŵad o Fangor heddiw.* - He is coming from Bangor today.\n-  *Dych chi'n mynd i **G**arno.* - You are going to **C**arno. *(c => g)*\n\n**Note** that *dŵad* is a regional variation of *dod* found in some mid- and north Wales dialects.\n\nMore information about the soft mutation, ***y treiglad meddal***, can be found [here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Welsh/Mutations#Soft_mutation) (a Wikibooks article).\n\n----\n####Placenames\nWe use placenames widely during the rest of the course to give context and variety when discussing travel, work, and so on.  You will also often come across them in the Welsh media.  Here are some that have separate Welsh and English names:\n\n|    *Enw Cymraeg*   |      English Name  | \n| -------------- | -------------- |\n|  *Abergwaun*   |  Fishguard         |\n|  *Casnewydd*   |  Newport        |\n|  *Caergybi*   |  Holyhead      |\n|  *Caerfyrddin* |  Carmarthen        |\n|  *Pwllheli*   |  Pwllheli*         |\n|  *Manceinion*   |  Manchester       |\n|  *Efrog Newydd*   |  New York        |\n|  *Amwythig*   |  Shrewsbury       |\n|  *Caergrawnt*  |  Cambridge         |\n|  *Y Bala*   |  Bala       |\n|  *Y Fenni*   |  Abergavenny        |\n|  *Y Bontfaen*   |  Cowbridge       |\n|   *Y Drenewydd*  |  Newtown         |\n|   *Castell-nedd*  |  Neath   |\n|   *Hendy Gwyn ar Daf* | Whitland  |\n\nLike most places in Wales. ***Pwllheli*** has only a Welsh name.  It is included here as it has a very high proportion of Welsh speakers, over 80% of its population at the last census.\n\n**Note** that in the examples where the Welsh name includes *y* (the), that this is not reflected in the English name.\n\n**Note** that some Welsh place names have more than one word where the English has only one, and vice versa.\n\n----\nA list of some English-language place names in Wales can be found [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_Wales) (Wikipedia article) and  some in the rest of the world [here]( \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_exonyms) (Wikipedia article).\n\nIf you want to know more about these places and where they are, just look in any good atlas or on the internet.  Many will have their own web sites and articles on their history.\n\n----\nMany place-names have common descriptive elements in them, and it can add interest to any journey through Wales if you get to know some of them.  A fuller list is available at  https://getoutside.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/guides/the-welsh-origins-of-place-names-in-britain/, but here are some common ones:\n\n|    *Cymraeg*   |   Meaning  | \n| -------------- | -------------- |\n|       *Aber*   |  Where one river flows into another body of water  |\n|  *Ban, Bannau*   |  Peak(s), beacon(s) |\n| *Bron*  |  Breast of a hill |\n|  *Bryn*   |  Hill |\n|  *Caer*   |  Fort |\n|  *Cas*   |  Castle |\n|  *Crug*   |  Hill, tump |\n|  *Cwm* | Valley |\n|  *Derw, Deri*  | Oaks  |\n| *Dinas* |  Hill-fort  |\n| *Dyffryn*   |  Valley, vale |\n| *Ffin*   |  Border, boundary |\n| *Isaf*   |  Lower, lowest |\n| *Llan*   |  Church, church land (often followed by the name of the saint to whom the church was dedicated, eg, Llangatwg - a place with a church dedicated to St Catwg)  |\n|  *Morfa* |  Salt-marsh  |\n|  *Nant*   |  Brook, dingle |\n|  *Pont*  |  Bridge |\n|  *Porth*   |  Gate  |\n|  *Rhos*   |  Moor  |\n|  *Tyle*   |  Hill-side, ascent  |\n| *Uchaf*   |  Upper, highest   |\n|  *Ystrad*   |  Vale  |\n\n----","urlName":"Places1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":35,"id":"4045c956312561bf70fe84bb7e699d01","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Dialects 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Dialects 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####'Identification' sentences\n\nWhen we want to say what or who someone is - their name, their occupation or whether they are male or female and so on, this is termed an 'identification sentence'. \n\n-  I'm Dewi\n-  He is a teacher\n-  Sioned is a mechanic\n-  She is a girl\n\n**Remember** that in Welsh, identification sentences use the emphatic construction, with the 'identity' being put first in the sentence.  \n\n**Remember** that with the third person verb this means that the 'identity' is followed by *ydy/yw*, never by *mae*:\n\n-  *Dewi dw i*\n-  *Athro ydy o*\n-  *Mecanig yw Sioned*\n-  *Geneth ydy hi*   -  (*geneth* - girl)\n-  *Pobydd dych chi* - (*pobydd* - baker)\n\n----\n####The five main Welsh dialect areas\n\nA variety of dialects are used in the Welsh-language media, so it is useful to become at least a little familar with some of the main variants as you start to learn the language.\n\nAlthough people often refer to there being two main variants of *Cymraeg*, this greatly over-simplifies the reality.  There are four or five commonly-recognised main dialect areas (see more below).\n\nThe five generally recognised dialects are:\n\n-  *y Wendodeg* -  north-west Wales\n-  *y Bowyseg* - north-east and northern mid-Wales \n-  *Iaith Sir Benfro* - north Pembrokeshire Welsh\n-  *y Ddyfedeg* - southern mid-Wales and south-west Wales *(Dyfed)*\n-  *Y Wenhwyseg* - south and south-east Wales\n\nA map of four of the five the main dialect areas is [here](http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/86299969977) although it includes the north Pembrokeshire dialect as part of the *Dyfedeg* dialect.\n\nThe dialect areas are not at all as distinct as the map may imply, and in many areas you may hear several words in use for the same thing, and several variations in the details of grammar.  These often vary by the age of the person speaking, particularly as younger people tend to move around more for work and education, with the result that their language can tend to mix dialects and to standardise.\n\nFor examples of the actual complexity on the ground, look at examples such as these, which, although they cover only the vocabulary and not local variations in pronunciation and grammar, emphasise the lack of clear-cut dialect boundaries:\n\n-  [Words for cowshed](http://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/13242)\n-  [Words for gate](http://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/13243)\n\nThere are local dialect words and pronunciations for such everyday things as girl, boy, hedge, farm lane and so on. Milk can be *llaeth, llâth, llefrith*. Large/big is usually *mawr*, but pronounced */mowr/* in much of the south-west. \n\nHere are some variations for 'table', 'grass', and 'iron':  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6oFM0_Iszwucu8_lmEhmk44elcxCCgB\n\n*Adre* ('homewards') is often pronounced */adra/* in the north-west and the south-east and as */adre/* elsewhere, but it sometimes appears as *tua thre* (pronounced */sha thre/*) in the south and south-east.\n\n*-au* endings (eg *dechrau, cefnau*) are often pronounced */-a/, (/dechra, cefna/)* in the north-west and south-east, but */-e/ (/dechre/, /cefne/)* in the north-east, mid-Wales and the south-west.\n\n*Cael* might be heard as */câl/* in the south-west and */ciêl, ciel/* in mid-Wales.\n\n*Roedd hi'n oer* may be heard as */wedd hi'n wer/* in Pembrokeshire.\n\n*Gwybod* is often */gwpod/* in south-east Wales, and *dw i ddim yn gwybod* tends to be *sa i'n gwpod*.\n\nMore information here - https://museum.wales/articles/2011-03-29/The-Dialects-of-Wales/\n\n----\nHere are some words introduced in this unit and in which broad area they tend to be more common:\n\n|  English | west and south Wales | north Wales |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| boy | *crwt, bachgen* | *hogyn* (NW), *bachgen* (NE) |\n|  girl | *merch* | *hogan* (NW), *geneth* (NW/NE) |\n|  milk |  *llaeth, /llâth/* | *llefrith* |\n|   you are |  *dych chi, /ych chi/, /ŷch chi/, /dech chi/* |    *dach chi, /dech chi/*|\n|  woman | *menyw* | *dynes* |\n|  is not | *dyw, dydy* | *dydy* |\n| is | *yw, ydy, /odi/* | *ydy, ydi, /'di/*  |\n|  liking | *hoffi/licio/lico* | *hoffi/licio* |\n| he is | *mae e, /ma' e/, /ma' fe/* | *mae o* |\n| you (singular, informal) | *ti* | *ti, chdi* |\n| hi, how are things? | */shwmae/* | *s'mae* |\n| a want, (wanting) | *eisiau, /isia/, /isie/, (moyn)* | */isio/* |\n| with | *gyda* (+ aspirate mutation) | *efo* (no mutation)|\n| to be able to | *gallu* | *medru* |\n| coming | *dod* | *dod, dŵad* |\n| out | *ma's, mas, allan* | *allan* |\n| yes; no | *ie; nage* | *ie, ia; naci* |\n| Where? | *Ble?* | *Lle?, Ble?* |\n\nMany other variants are also common, such as:\n\n-  *perth, sietin, clawdd, gwrych* for 'hedge' in various areas\n\nA very big topic that this course can only skim!\n\nThere are examples of several dialects here - https://museum.wales/articles/2011-03-29/The-Dialects-of-Wales/  \n\n----","urlName":"Dialects-1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":11,"id":"d9d920cee80a02287be39f9a854fd69f","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"May I?","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"May I?","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Soft mutation\nYou may have heard of mutations in the Welsh language.  In this unit we again use the first, and by far the most most common of these - soft mutation.\n\nAfter certain words and patterns, some consonants at the start of words 'soften'.  Here is the complete list:\n\n| Original letter | Soft mutated letter |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| p |  b |\n| t  | d |\n| c | g |\n| b | f |\n| d | dd |\n| g | - |\n| m | f |\n| ll | l |\n| rh | r |\n\n(Note that the *g* vanishes when it undergoes soft mutation)\n\nThe main reason for soft mutation is that it allows the language to **flow** better when spoken, although sometimes it is due to reasons of grammar. \n\nMore information about the soft mutation, ***y treiglad meddal***, can be found here https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Welsh/Mutations#Soft_mutation.\n\nAs you go through the course you will come across some more of the main reasons for soft mutation.  Just pick them up and practise them as you go.  **Above all, when speaking Welsh do not worry if you miss a mutation**.\n\nWhen you use a dictionary to look up a word you may need to take a possible mutation into account.  *Ofyn* will not be in the dictionary, for example - you would need to look up *Gofyn*.  Luckily, some on-line dictionaries such as www.gweiadur.com, and smartphone apps such as *Ap Geiriaduron* will handle mutated words.\n\n----\n####May I?\n**Ga i...?** is a very important phrase in Welsh meaning, simply:\n\n-  'May I ...' or 'Can I have (something)?'\n-  'May I ...' or 'Can I (do something)?'\n\n\nWe use *Ga i...?* to ask for things:\n\n-  *Ga i afal?* - May I have an apple?\n\nWe also use it to ask for permission to do something:\n\n-  *Ga i **f**ynd?* - May I go? (notice the soft mutation here which has changed *mynd* (going, to go) to *fynd*\n\nThe object (*mynd*, here) of a short-form verb such as this always takes a soft mutation if it can.  Some more examples - check that you can see where the soft mutation comes in:\n\n- *Ga i **g**offi?* - May I have a coffee? *(coffi -> **g**offi)*\n-  *Ga i fynd nawr?* - May I go now?\n-  *Ga i goffi, plîs?* - Can I have a coffee, please\n-  *Ga i bapur?* - May I have a paper?\n-  *Ga i siwgr, plîs?* - May I have some sugar, please?  (note - *s* does not mutate)\n-  *Ga i ddiod?* - May I have a drink?\n-  *Ga i dalu nawr?*  - Can I pay now?\n\nIf there is more than one word in the object phrase, just the first element takes the soft mutation:\n\n-  *Ga i lyfr mawr?* - May I have a large book? (*llyfr* takes the mutation as the object of *ga?*)\n-  *Ga i'r llyfr?* - May I have the book?  (no mutation possible of *'r*)\n-  *Ga i **dd**au **l**yfr?* - May I have two books (*dau* takes the mutation because it is the first element of the object phrase, but the mutation of *llyfr* is for a different reason - it follows *dau*)\n\n----\n*Ga i?* is a question form of the verb-noun *cael*.  This has several meanings, one of which is 'to be allowed to', and it is this meaning that is being used in *Ga i...?*\n\n----\n####Answering\n-  *Ga i afal? Cei/Na chei.* - May I have an apple?  Yes/No. (*ti*-form)\n-  *Ga i afal? Cewch/Na chewch.* - May I have an apple?  Yes/No. (*chi*-form)\n\nNote the aspirate mutation following *na*:\n\n-  *na +* aspirate mutation *+ cewch => na chewch*\n\n----\n####Aspirate mutation\nThe aspirate mutation *(treiglad llaes)* is far less common than the soft mutation.  It only affects three initial consonants, *p, t, c*:\n\n-  *p => ph*\n-  *t => th*\n-  *c => ch*\n\nAmong other things, it follows *a* (and):\n\n-  *pannas a **ph**ys* - parsnips and peas\n-  *trên a **th**ractor* - a train and a tractor\n-  *coffi a **ch**acen* - coffee and cake\n\n----\n####Please\nThere are several ways of saying 'please':\n\n-  *Os gwelwch chi'n dda*.\n-  *Os gwelwch yn dda* - a slight variation.\n-  *Plîs* - simple and widely used, especially informally\n-  *Os gweli di'n dda* - The *ti* form.\n\n----\n####Verb-nouns\nThe basic form of verbs that you will look up in a Welsh dictionary is called a 'verb-noun'.  By the end of this unit you will have met, for example, *gofyn, talu, hoffi, yfed, gwneud* and several others.  The nearest equivalent in English is the '-ing' form of words - asking, paying, liking,... or the 'to xxx' form - to ask, to pay, to like, ....\n\n**Note** - if you are asked to translate this sort of word **on its own, not** as part of a longer phrase on this course, use the forms 'xxxing' or 'to xxx'. Do not answer with just 'xxx' (eat, like, drink, swim, etc) as those can often be mixed up with nouns (a swim, a drink, ...) or commands (eat!, drink!). \n\n----\n####Britishisms - a cup of tea or 'cuppa'\n'A cup of tea', or 'a cuppa' is a common thing to ask for in Britain.  The Welsh equivalent is *paned*, or in some dialects *disgled*.  *'Te'*/'tea' need not be specified.\n\nIf you mean 'a cup of coffee', say, you should specify *paned/disgled o goffi*.\n\n----","urlName":"Gai"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":4,"id":"34aa0a5b02473a577ab39d96a20a2894","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"PastWedi","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Wedi","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit teaches the present perfect tense, **yr amser perffaith**, using ***wedi***.\n\n----\nThis tense is used to describe something, saying that the activity has been completed - that is why the activity is 'perfect'!  \n\nThis tense can be seen in English with 'have/has', and often, although not always, followed with the '-ed' verb-ending. For example:\n\n-  I **have swum** 300 metres.\n-  We **have enjoyed** lunch, thank you.\n-  Siôn **has eaten** well this evening.\n-  She **has played** well today.\n-  They **have enjoyed** themselves.\n-  She **has paid** the bill already.\n\n**Note** that this tense is not the same as the simple past tense 'I swam', I enjoyed', 'I ate', 'I finished' - that is a different tense, the simple past, in both English and Welsh, and it is covered in later sections of the course.\n\n----\nIn the Welsh present tense we use forms of *bod* with *yn/'n*\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd* - I am going\n-  *Maen nhw'n bwyta pasta* - They are eating pasta.\n\nThere, *yn/'n* shows that the action is unfinished - it is still incomplete.  \n\nIn Welsh, the present perfect tense pattern uses the same present tense forms of *bod* and we simply use ***wedi*** instead of *yn/'n*, to show that that action has been completed - 'I have gone.', 'They have eaten..,'\n\n-  *Dw i **wedi nofio** 300 metr.* -  I **have swum** 300 metres. (But not 'I swam...' - that is a different tense, the simple past).)\n-  *Dyn ni **wedi mwynhau** cinio.* - We **have enjoyed** lunch.  (But not 'We enjoyed...')\n-  *Mae Siôn **wedi bwyta**'n dda heno.* - Siôn **has eaten** well this evening. (But not 'Siôn ate...')\n\n**Note** that *yn/'n* is never used at the same time as *wedi* -  the action cannot be incomplete and complete at the same time.  For example, * *Dw i'n wedi mynd* would make no sense.\n\nMore examples:\n\n-  *Dw i wedi gorffen.*  - I have finished.\n-  *Mae'r plant wedi codi.*  - The children have got up.\n-  *Mae Sioned wedi yfed coffi.* - Sioned has drunk a coffee.\n-  *Dyn ni wedi chwarae pêl-droed.* - We have played football.\n-  *Dw i wedi mynd i siopa.* - I have gone shopping.\n-  *Mae e wedi darllen y nofel.* - He has read the novel.\n\n----\n####Questions\nQuestions can be asked and answered in the same way as with the present tense:\n\n-  *Wyt ti wedi cael cinio? Ydw* - Have you had lunch? Yes.\n-  *Ydy hi wedi mynd?  Ydy.*  Has she gone?  Yes.\n-  *Ydyn nhw wedi bod yno eto? Nac ydyn* - Have they been there yet? No.\n\nIn parts of north Wales, and as taught in the 'north' versions of the intoductory and intermediate *DysguCymraeg* courses, *Do/Naddo* can be used in answers to questions in the present perfect tense with *wedi*:\n\n-  *Dan ni wedi bod yma o'r blaen?  Do/Naddo.* - Have we been here before?  Yes/No.\n-  *Dach chi wedi gorffen y gwaith? Do/Naddo.* - Have you finished the work?  Yes/No.\n-  *Ydy o wedi dŵad i weld Siân?  Do/Naddo.* - has he come to see Siân?  Yes/No.\n\n----\n####Negatives\nNegatives also work in the same way as with the present tense:\n\n-  *Dw i **ddim wedi** bod i Sbaen eto.* - I **have not** been to Spain yet.\n-  *Dydyn nhw **ddim wedi** bod yn yr Almaen o'r blaen.* - They **have not** been in Germany before.\n-  *Dydy'r plant **ddim wedi** bwyta wyau heddiw* - the children **haven't** eaten any eggs today.\n\n----\n####*Golchi* vs *ymolchi* - washing vs getting washed\n\n*ym-* is quite a common verb prefix in Welsh.  It often indicates a reflexive action - something that someone does to themselves.  This is not always obvious in the English translation.  In *golchi* (washing) and *ymolchi* (washing oneself, getting washed) it is very clear, though:\n\n-  *Mae hi wedi golchi'r car.* - She has washed the car.\n-  *Mae hi wedi ymolchi.* - She has got washed; She has washed herself; She has had a wash.\n\n----","urlName":"PastTens1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"e1ccfcc33045ca31c8e7cda1acc08ae5","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Time","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Time","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"When telling the time in Cymraeg, the traditional (vigesimal - 20-based) system of counting is used for some of the numbers:\n\n-  11 – *un ar ddeg* (one on ten)\n-  12 – *deuddeg* (two ten)\n-  15 - *pymtheg*\n-  20 – *ugain*\n-  25 – *pump ar hugain* (five on twenty)\n\n**Note** that *ugain* gains an *h-* when used after *ar*\n\n**Remember** that the singular form of the noun is always used if it comes directly after the number.  Therefore, \"five minutes\" is *pum munud*.\n\nSometimes there is a change to the spelling of a number before nouns as noted here:\n\n-  *Un funud* - *un* causes weak soft mutation of a following singular feminine noun.\n-  *Dwy funud* - *dau* becomes *dwy* before feminine nouns.  Also note that both *dau* and *dwy* cause soft mutation of a following word..\n-  *Tair munud* - *tri* becomes *tair* when used before singular feminine nouns.\n-  *Pedair munud* - *pedwar* becomes *pedair* when used before singular feminine nouns.\n-  *Pum munud* - *pump* changes to *pum* when used before  nouns.\n-  *Chwe munud* - *chwech* changes to *chwe* when used before nouns.\n-  *Deng munud* - *deg* may change to *deng* (traditionally - not always done now) when used before *munud*.\n\n**Note** that in some areas, *munud* is a masculine noun, so you will find *un munud, dau funud, tri munud, pedwar munud*.\n\n----\nThe *Cymraeg* for 'o’clock' is *o’r gloch* (literally - 'of the bell').  \n\nTo ask 'What time is it?' you say *Faint o’r gloch ydy hi?*:\n\n-  *Mae hi’n un o’r gloch* - It is one o’clock.\n-  *Mae hi’n saith o’r gloch* -  It is seven o’clock.\n-  *Mae hi’n wyth o’r gloch* - It is eight o’clock.\n\n**Note** that for an abstract 'it', such as when referring time, distance or weather, we use the pronoun *hi*.\n\nWe can also ask to confirm the time - 'Is it ... o'clock?':\n\n-  *Ydy hi'n un o'r gloch?* -  Is it one o'clock?\n-  *Ydy hi'n wyth o'r gloch?* - Is it eight o'clock?\n\nAnd we can add *eto*, meaning 'yet':\n\n-  *Ydy hi'n chwech o'r gloch eto?* - Is it six o'clock yet?\n\n**Note** that *Mae hi’n...* or *Ydy hi'n...?* causes a soft mutation to the number which follows:\n\n-  *Mae hi’n **dd**au o’r gloch* - It’s two o’clock\n-  *Mae hi’n **d**ri o’r gloch* - It’s three o’clock\n-  *Mae hi’n **b**edwar o’r gloch* - It’s four o’clock\n-  *Mae hi’n **b**ump o’r gloch* - It’s five o’clock\n-  *Mae hi’n **dd**eg o’r gloch* - It’s ten o’clock\n-  *Mae hi’n **dd**euddeg o’r gloch* - It’s twelve o’clock\n-  *Ydy hi'n **dd**au o'r gloch?* - Is it two o'clock?\n-  *Ydy hi'n **d**ri o'r gloch?* - Is it three o'clock?\n-  etc...\n\n**Half past** the hour is expressed as *hanner awr wedi …* (note that *awr* is always used) and 'quarter past' as *chwarter wedi …* (no *awr*):\n\n-  *Mae hi’n hanner awr wedi dau.* - It is half past two.\n-  *Mae hi’n hanner awr wedi pump.* - It is half past five.\n-  *Mae hi’n chwarter wedi chwech.* - It is (a) quarter past six.\n-  *Mae hi’n chwarter wedi tri.* - It is (a) quarter past three.\n\n**Quarter to** the hour is *chwarter i ...*  *i* causes soft mutation of the following word:.\n\n-  *Mae hi’n chwarter i dri* -

It revises the soft mutation and introduces the nasal mutation.\n\n----\n####To and from - *i* and *o* with soft mutation\n\nWhen saying \"to somewhere\" or \"from somewhere\" in Cymraeg, the prepositions ***i*** ('to') and ***o*** ('from, of') are used. \n\nNote the **soft mutation after *i* and *o* ** - this happens whenever *i* is used to mean 'to', and where *o* is used to mean 'from' or 'of'.\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *i Gymru* - to Wales\n-  *i Lydaw* - to Brittany\n-  *o Batagonia* - from Patagonia\n-  *o Gaerdydd* - from Cardiff\n-  *i Lanidloes* - to Llanidloes\n-  *i Ros* - to Rhos\n-  *o Lundain* - from London\n-  *o Ddolgellau* - from Dolgellau\n-  *i Fangor* - to Bangor\n\n\n----\n####Countries and Oceans\nSome places in *Cymraeg* have *y/yr* in front of them.

When it is used as a particle to link to verbs or to nouns and adjectives, it does get abbreviated:\n\n-  *Dw i **yn** Aber* - I am in Aber - no abbreviation\n-  *Dw i**'n** mynd* - I am going - abbreviation\n-  *Dw i**'n** hapus* - I am happy - abbreviation\n\n**Remember** that *yn* never causes soft mutation of words beginning with *ll-* or *rh-*, no matter what function it has in the sentence:\n\n-  *Dydy Siôn ddim **yn ll**on iawn **yn Ll**undain neu **yn Rh**os.* - Siôn is not very cheerful in London or in Rhos.\n\n----\n####**Nasal** mutations following *yn* when it is a preposition meaning 'in'\n\nWhen *yn* means 'in', **and only then**, it causes a **nasal** mutation of several letters (never a soft mutation) and can undergo changes itself.  \n\nHere is the nasal mutation - note the pattern where there is an *-h-* in the first three in the list, but no *-h-* in the second three:\n\n-  ***P-*** -> ***Mh-***\n-  ***T-*** -> ***Nh-***\n-  ***C-*** -> ***Ngh-***\n-  ***B-*** -> ***M-***\n-  ***D-*** -> ***N-***\n-  ***G-*** -> ***Ng-***\n\n**Only when it means 'in'**, *yn* changes to *ym* before *m-*, and to *yng* before *ng-*.  Here are some examples with some names of Welsh towns showing both the nasal mutation and the changes to *yn*:\n\n-  *Pwllheli - y**m Mh**wllheli* - in Pwllheli\n-  *Tywyn - yn **Nh**ywyn* - in Tywyn\n-  *Caerdydd - y**ng Ngh**aerdydd*\n-  *Bangor - y**m M**angor*\n-  *Dolgellau - yn **N**olgellau*\n-  *Garn - y**ng Ng**arn*\n\n----\n####Other - *Arall, Eraill*\nThe adjective *arall* (other, another) has a plural form *eraill* which must be used with plural nouns:\n\n-  *y ferch arall; y merched eraill* - the other girl; the other girls\n-  *gwlad arall; gwledydd eraill* - another country; other countries\n\n----\n####The Welsh flag, The Scottish team, ...\n\nThere is a particular pattern to use when describing 'the something of somewhere' or 'the something's something'.\n\n**Remember** how we say 'Owen's car':\n\n-  *car Owen* - Owen's car (= 'the car of Owen')\n\nThe equivalents of 'the' and 'of' in the awkward-sounding, expanded English version are not needed in the Welsh:\n\n-  *blows Sioned* - Sioned's blouse (= 'the blouse of Sioned')\n-  *tŷ fy mam* - my mother's house (= 'the house of my mother')\n\nSimilarly, 'the Welsh team' ('the team of Wales') translates as *tîm Cymru* - no *y/yr/'r*:\n\n-  *tîm Norwy* - the Norwegian team\n-  *tîm Ffrainc* - the French team\n-  *baner yr Alban* - the Scottish flag\n\n**Note** that the *yr* is only there in the third example because *yr Alban* is the word for 'Scotland'.\n\n-  *baner Cymru* - the Welsh flag  ('the flag of Wales')\n-  *tîm Lloegr* - the English team\n-  *cefn gwlad Ffrainc* - the French countryside\n\nSo:\n\n-  *lliw **baner Cymru*** - the colour(s) of **the Welsh flag** \n\nThere is still no *y/yr/'r* in the Welsh phrase.\n\n----","urlName":"Gwledydd2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":20,"id":"36417893585c9f212260541ca07d0767","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Travelling","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Travelling","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces some vocabulary and patterns  to use about travelling.\n\n----\n####Where?\n\nTo ask 'Where?', we use *Ble?*.  In some mid-and north Wales dialects you will come across *Lle?* instead:\n\n-  *Ble dych chi'n mynd ar eich gwyliau?* - Where are you going on your holiday?\n-  *Ble mae hi'n mynd i gwrdd â Dewi?* - Where is she going to meet Dewi?\n-  *Lle dach chi'n aros nos yfory?* - Where are you staying tomorrow night?\n-  *Lle bydd y cynhebrwng?* - Where will the funeral be?\n\n----\n####Here is... There is...\n\nIf you want to **show** something or **point out** something to somebody, as in 'Here is a good place to sit', 'This is a nice cake', we use:\n\n-  *Dyma...* - 'Here is...' or 'This is...'\n\nA similar word is used for 'There is his car', That is a nice cake':\n\n-  *Dyna...* - There is...' or 'That is...'\n\nBoth words are followed by a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Dyma **g**adair gyfforddus* - Here's a comfortable chair *(cadair)*\n-  *Dyma **d**rên* - Here is/This is a train. *(trên)*\n-  *Dyma'r cacen!* - This is the cake!\n-  *Dyma **g**acen* - Here's a cake.\n-  *Dyna Hefin!* - There's Hefin!\n-  *Dyna **w**esty ddrud* - There's an expensive hotel. *(gwesty)*\n\n----\n#### Superlative (-est) forms of adjectives\n\nThis section introduces the word *nesa*, meaning 'next' or 'nearest'.  The fuller form of this is *nesaf*, but the final *-f* is often dropped in colloquial speech and writing.\n\nThis is an example of a superlative adjective, the '-est' form such as nearest, closest, best, furthest, dearest, greenest, biggest and so on.\n\nSuperlative adjectives ending in *-a* are not always shown in a Welsh dictionary, so remember to look them up with an ending of *-af*.\n\n----\n####Doing something 'next/last month'\n\n**Remember** that when saying we are doing something on a particular day we mutate *dydd...* to *ddydd...*.  This is because *ddydd Llun*, say, is being used as an adverb to say when we are doing it.  We do the same with *mis nesa* (next month) and *mis diwetha* (last month) if we use those in the same way:\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd ar wyliau **dd**ydd Gwener.* - I am going on holuday on Friday.\n-  *Mae hi'n mynd ar wyliau **f**is nesa.* - She is going on holiday next month.\n-  *Aethon ni i'r Alban **f**is diwetha.* - We went to Scotland last month.\n\n----","urlName":"Traveling"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"b5858d51b5326c09b9b968d7bc389fe8","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Past Dod 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"P. Dod 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####The simple past of *dod*\n(For those people who already know some Welsh, note that this course does not cover the more formal forms of the language where the pronouns may get dropped - responses without the pronouns may not be accepted.)\n\n----\n####The simple past\nThe **simple past** tense, for example:\n\n-  I came\n-  You came\n\nis not the same as the present perfect tense which was covered earlier:\n\n-  I have come\n-  You have come\n\n----\n####The irregular verbs\n\nThe four verbs in this unit and the others close to it in the course are 'irregular' - they do not follow the normal pattern in forming their tenses.  The four verbs here are:\n\n-  *mynd* (going, to go), \n-  *dod* (coming, to come),\n-  *gwneud* (making, to make; doing, to do) and\n-  *cael* (getting, to get; having, to have). \n\n####I came, You came\n\nIn the short-form of the verbs, which you are meeting in these units for the first time on this course, there is no form of *bod* being used to help to form the expression.  It is simply the verb followed by the person carrying out the action:\n\n-  *Des i* - I came\n-  *Dest ti* - You came (singular informal 'you')\n-  *Daethoch chi* - You came (formal or plural 'you')\n\n----\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, *Mi* may be added in front of the verb, especially for emphasis.  It is only used with a positive statement, never with questions or negatives.  *Mi* causes a soft mutation of the verb:\n\n-  *Mi **dd**es i* - I came\n-  *Mi **dd**est ti* - You came (informal singular 'you')\n-  *Mi **dd**aethoch chi* - You came (formal or plural 'you')\n\nIn other areas of Wales you may come across *Fe* being used instead of *Mi*, although this is perhaps less common nowadays.\n\n----\n####Questions and Yes and No\n\nWe form the question simply by adding a soft mutation at the start of the verb, a question mark at the end of the sentence in writing, and by raising the tone at the end of the sentence when speaking:\n\n-  *Ddes i yma gyda ti?* - Did I come here with you?\n-  *Ddest ti i'r tŷ?* - Did you come to the house?\n-  *Ddaethoch chi i Aber ddoe?* - Did you come to Aber yesterday?\n\nIn the simple past tense there is only one form of **Yes** and one form of **No**\n\n-  *Do* = Yes         \n-  *Naddo* = No\n\n-  *Ddaethoch chi yma ddoe?  Do.* - Did you come here yesterday?  Yes.\n-  *Ddest ti i Aber gyda/efo Siân?  Naddo, gyda/efo Siwan.* - Did you come to Aber with Siân?  No, with Siwan.\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nSimply use the mixed mutation (soft in the case of *dod*) with *ddim* for a negative::\n\n-  *Ddes i ddim yma tan 2010.* - I didn't come here until 2010.\n-  *Ddaethoch chi ddim i Aber ddoe.* - You didn't come to Aber yesterday.\n\n----\n####The full simple past conjugations of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael*\nFor reference, the full pattern of the simple past tense of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael* in the general colloquial language is as follows, starting with *mynd*:\n\n-  *Es i*\n-  *Est ti*\n-  *Aeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Aethon ni*\n-  *Aethoch chi*\n-  *Aethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *dod*:\n\n-  *Des i*\n-  *Dest ti*\n-  *Daeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Daethon ni*\n-  *Daethoch chi*\n-  *Daethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *gwneud* (note that the initial *g-* is sometimes dropped in the colloquial language, and that if that happens the *-w-* is often not pronounced either):\n\n-  *Gwnes i*\n-  *Gwnest ti*\n-  *Gwnaeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Gwnaethon ni*\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi*\n-  *Gwnaethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *cael* (note that these forms are often seen with the mutation *c- -> g-* in the colloquial language):\n\n-  *Ces i*\n-  *Cest ti*\n-  *Caeth/Cafodd e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson ni*\n-  *Caethoch/Cawsoch chi*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson nhw*\n\n----\n**Note** that in parts of Mid- and north Wales these are often used and taught with a preceding particle *mi* and a soft mutation.

The four verbs here are:\n\n-  *mynd* (going, to go), \n-  *dod* (coming, to come),\n-  *gwneud* (making, to make; doing, to do) and\n-  *cael* (getting, to get; having, to have). \n\n####I got, You got\n\nIn the short-form of the verbs, which you are meeting in these units for the first time on this course, there is no form of *bod* being used to help to form the expression.  It is simply the verb followed by the person carrying out the action.\n\nThese are the forms taught in the introductory *DysguCymraeg* courses:\n\n-  *Ces i* - I got\n-  *Cest ti* - You got (singular informal 'you')\n-  *Cawsoch chi* - You got (formal or plural 'you')\n\nYou may also come across:\n\n-  *Caethoch chi* - You got\n\n----\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, *Mi* may be added in front of the verb (only when it is a statement, not a question or a negative), especially for emphasis.  *Mi* causes a soft mutation of the verb. These are the forms taught in the introductory *DysguCymraeg* 'north' courses:\n\n-  *Mi ges i* - I got\n-  *Mi gest ti* - You got (informal singular 'you')\n-  *Mi gaethoch chi* - You got (formal or plural 'you')\n\nIn other areas of Wales you may come across *Fe* being used instead of *Mi*.\n\nYou may also come across *ges i, gest ti, gaethoch chi*, where the soft mutation remains in a positive statement even though the particle *fe/mi* is not used.\n\n----\n####Soft mutation following a short-form verb\n\nNote that the object of a short-form verb, the thing that has been got/sold/bought/etc, takes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Ces i **g**offi* - I got/had a coffee *(coffi)*\n-  *Cest ti **dd**illad newydd* - You got/had some new clothes *(dillad)*\n-  *Cawsoch chi **l**yfr newydd* - You got a new book *(llyfr)*\n\n----\n####Questions and Yes/No\n\nWe form the question simply by adding a soft mutation at the start of the verb, a question mark at the end of the sentence in writing and by raising the tone at the end of the sentence when speaking:\n\n-  *Ges i goffi?* - Did I have a coffee?\n-  *Gest ti ddillad?* - Did you get some clothes?\n-  *Gawsoch/Gaethoch chi hwyl yno?* - Did you have fun there?\n\nIn the simple past tense there is only one form of **Yes** and one form of **No**\n\n-  *Do* = Yes         \n-  *Naddo* = No\n\n-  *Gawsoch/Gaethoch chi dywydd braf yno?  Do.* - Did you have fine weather there?  Yes.\n-  *Gest ti hwyl yn Aber?  Naddo, roedd hi'n rhy oer.* - Did you have fun in Aber?  No, it was too cold.\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nSimply use the mixed mutation (aspirate in the case of *cael*) with *ddim* for a negative:\n\n-  *Ches i ddim tywydd braf yno* - I didn't have any fine weather there\n-  *Chawsoch/Chaethoch chi ddim dillad newydd oi'ch pen-blwydd* - You didn't get any new clothes for your birthday\n\n**Note** that the soft mutation is taken by *dim => ddim*.\n\n----\n####The full simple past conjugations of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael*\nFor reference, the full pattern of the simple past tense of *mynd, dod, gwneud* and *cael* in the general colloquial language is as follows, starting with *mynd*:\n\n-  *Es i*\n-  *Est ti*\n-  *Aeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Aethon ni*\n-  *Aethoch chi*\n-  *Aethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *dod*:\n\n-  *Des i*\n-  *Dest ti*\n-  *Daeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Daethon ni*\n-  *Daethoch chi*\n-  *Daethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *gwneud* (note that the initial *g-* is sometimes dropped in the colloquial language, and that if that happens the *-w-* is often not pronounced either):\n\n-  *Gwnes i*\n-  *Gwnest ti*\n-  *Gwnaeth e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Gwnaethon ni*\n-  *Gwnaethoch chi*\n-  *Gwnaethon nhw*\n\nSimple past of *cael* (note that these forms are often seen with the mutation *c- -> g-* in the colloquial language):\n\n-  *Ces i*\n-  *Cest ti*\n-  *Caeth/Cafodd e/hi/Siân/y plant*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson ni*\n-  *Caethoch/Cawsoch chi*\n-  *Caethon/Cawson nhw*\n\n----\n**Note** that in parts of Mid- and north Wales these are often used and taught with a preceding particle *mi* and a soft mutation.

In this section on possessive pronouns all three mutations are going to be used.  Here is a summary table of mutations that you can copy and keep somewhere convenient for reference.\n\n| Letter | Soft | Nasal | Aspirate |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| ***p*** | *b* |  *mh*| *ph*|\n| ***t*** | *d* | *nh*| *th* |\n| ***c*** | *g* | *ngh* | *ch* |\n| ***b*** | *f* | *m* | \n| ***d*** | *dd* | *n* | \n| ***g*** |  *-*  | *ng* |\n| ***m*** | *f* |\n| ***ll*** * | *l*|\n| ***rh*** * | *r* | \n\n**Note** that:\n\n-  Letters not shown do not take a mutation.\n-  Not all the letters take all the mutations.\n-  In soft mutation, an initial *g-* is removed.\n-  *b-* and *m-* both take a soft mutation to *f-*.\n-  In a 'mixed' mutation, as explained in the relevant course notes about negative verbs, *p-, t-, c-* take an aspirate mutation and the others take a soft mutation.\n-  In a very few circumstances, as explained in the relevant course notes, *ll-* and *rh-* (marked here with asterisks) resist a soft mutation.  This is sometimes known as a 'weak' soft mutation.\n\nMore details about the mutations can be found here http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learnwelsh/pdf/welshgrammar_mutations.pdf or here http://clwbmalucachu.co.uk/cmc/cheat/cheat_mutations.htm.\n\n----\n####The possessive pronouns - my, your, etc\nAfter several possessive pronouns, there is a mutation. \n\n-  After ***fy*** (my), there is a nasal mutation.\n-  After ***dy*** (your) and ***ei*** (his), there is a soft mutation.\n-  After **ei** (her), there is an aspirate mutation. **Also**, ***ei*** (her) adds ***h-*** if the following word starts with a vowel (*a e i o u w y* in Welsh). \n-  After ***ein*** (our) and ***eu*** (their) an ***h-*** is added to a following word if it starts with a vowel.\n\nAfter the thing being owned, there is sometimes also an echoing pronoun, which emphasises or clarifies who is owning it, especially with 'his' vs 'hers'.  These are optional, unless required to be certain of meaning.  They are shown below in the list below:\n\n-  *Fy ... i* - my (+ nasal mutation)\n-  *Dy ... di* your (+ soft mutation)\n-  *Ei ... e/o* - his (+ soft mutation)\n-  *Ei ... hi* - her, (+ aspirate mutation, or + *h-* to following vowel-words)\n-  *Ein ... ni* - our (plus *h-* to following vowel-words)\n-  *Eich ... chi* - your\n-   *Eu ... nhw* - their (plus *h-* to following vowel-words)\n \n**Remember** that *dy* (your) is related to *ti* (you - familar and singular) and that *eich* (your) is related to *chi* (you - any plural, or unfamilar singular).\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *fy **ngh**ar (i)* - nasal mutation\n-  *dy **g**ar (di)* - soft mutation\n-  *ei **g**ar (o/e)* - soft mutation\n-  *ei **ch**ar* (hi) - aspirate mutation\n-  *ein car (ni)*\n-  *eich car (chi)*\n-  *eu car (nhw)*\n\nAnd now, showing the *h-* added after some possessives:\n\n-  *fy athro (i)*\n-  *dy athro (di)*\n-  *ei athro (o/e)*\n-  *ei **h**athro (hi)* - *+ h-*\n-  *ein **h**athro ni* - *+ h-*\n-  *eich athro (chi)*\n-  *eu **h**athro (nhw)* - *+ h-*\n\nOther examples:\n\n-  *fy **ng**ŵr (i)* - my husband\n-  *dy chwaer (di)* - your sister\n-  *dy **f**rawd (di)* - your brother\n-  *ei **f**odryb (e/o)* - his aunt\n-  *ei modryb (hi)* - her aunt\n-  *ei **h**anti (hi)* - her aunt\n-  *eu brawd (nhw)* - their brother\n-  *eich gwraig/gŵr/chwaer/brawd (chi)* - your wife/husband/sister/brother\n-  *eu **h**ewythr/**h**wncl (nhw)* - their uncle\n\n-----\n####Grandparents\n\nThere are two pairs of words used for Grandmother/Grandfather: *Nain/Taid* and *Mam-gu/Tad-cu*.\n\nTypically, *Nain/Taid* is more often used in northern dialects and *Mam-gu/Tad-cu* in southern areas.  In practice, though, it can vary between families even in the same area.\n\n----\n####Knowing people and places and knowing facts.\nIn Welsh, as in several other modern languages, there are two different words used for 'knowing':\n\n-  *gwybod* - knowing facts\n-  *nabod* - knowing people and places\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gwybod ei lyfr e'n dda iawn.* - I know his book very well.\n-  *Mae Dewi'n gwybod sut mae'r injan yn gweithio* - Dewi knows how the engine works.\n-  *Wyt ti'n nabod Siân?* - Do you know Siân?\n-  *Wyt ti'n gwybod sut mae Siân?* - Do you know how Siân is?\n-  *Ydy Dewi'n nabod y dref?*  Does Dewi know the town?\n-  *Ydy Dewi'n gwybod sut i gyrraedd y llyfrgell?* - Does Dewi know how to get to the library?\n\n-----","urlName":"Family1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"d6f35af185ac6bf2054a323ae0b6680f","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Past Dod 2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"P.

This can be seen with other combinations of prepositions and possessives, too:\n\n-  *a + ei => a'i*\n-  *a + ein => a'n*\n-  *a + eich => a'ch*\n-  *a + eu => a'u*\n-  *gyda + ei => gyda'i*\n-  *efo + ein => efo'n*\n-  *o + eich => o'ch*\n-  *â + ein => â'n*\n-  *â + eu => â'u*\n-  *i + ein => i'n*\n-  *etc*\n\n**Note** that after *i* (to/for) there is a different form with *ei/eu*:\n\n-  *i + ei -> i'w*\n-  *i + eu -> i'w*\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd efo'i ffrindiau o* - I'm going with his friends\n-  *Mae e'n mynd i'w thŷ* - He is going to her house\n-  *Maen nhw'n prynu tatws i'w mam nhw* - They are buying potatoes for their mother.\n-  *Dw i'n dawnsio gyda'u brawd nhw* - I am dancing with their brother\n\n----\n####Table of the mutations\n\nAs a reminder, here is a summary of the Welsh mutations of initial letters:\n\n| Letter | Soft | Nasal | Aspirate |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| ***p*** | *b* |  *mh*| *ph*|\n| ***t*** | *d* | *nh*| *th* |\n| ***c*** | *g* | *ngh* | *ch* |\n| ***b*** | *f* | *m* | \n| ***d*** | *dd* | *n* | \n| ***g*** |  *-*  | *ng* |\n| ***m*** | *f* |\n| ***ll*** * | *l*|\n| ***rh*** * | *r* | \n\n**Note** that:\n\n-  Letters not shown do not take a mutation.\n-  Not all the letters take all the mutations.\n-  In soft mutation, an initial *g-* is removed.\n-  *b-* and *m-* both take a soft mutation to *f-*.\n-  In a 'mixed' mutation, as explained in the relevant course notes about negative verbs, *p-, t-, c-* take an aspirate mutation and the others take a soft mutation.\n-  In a very few circumstances, as explained in the relevant course notes, *ll-* and *rh-* (marked here with asterisks) resist a soft mutation.  This is sometimes known as a 'weak' soft mutation.\n\n----","urlName":"Family2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"016273eb6c4e14bf47406fcda8f0b587","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Past Short","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Past Short","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####The Simple past tense\nThere are two common ways of forming the simple past:\n\n-  By adding the appropriate ending to the stem of a verb to make a 'short-form' verb.\n-  By using the simple past of  *gwneud* (doing, making) as an auxiliary verb to make a 'long-form' verb. \n\nThis section of the course shows how to use the first method, adding a simple past tense ending to the stem of the verb.\n\n**Note** that there are other ways of creating the simple past tense in some dialects, but this course does not cover them.\n\n----\n####The short-form simple past tense\nThe **short-form** past tense uses the stem of the verb.  This is usually formed by removing:\n\n-  *-a, -i, -o, -u, -eg, -ed, -an, -yd, -yll*\n\nfrom the final syllable of the verb-noun.\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *busnes**a** -> busnes-* (meddling, to meddle)\n-  *cefnog**i** -> cefnog-*  (supporting)\n-  *ffoni**o** -> ffoni-* - (phoning)\n-  *tynn**u** -> tynn-* (pulling)\n-  *rhed**eg** -> rhed-* (running, to run)\n-  *cerdd**ed** -> cerdd-*  (walking)\n\nFor other verbs there is often no change:\n\n- *darllen -> darllen-*  (reading)\n- *siarad -> siarad-*   (speaking)\n\nThere are some common exceptions that have irregular stems.  For example:\n\n-  *gweld => gwel-*  (seeing)\n-  *sefyll => saf-*  (standing)\n-  *aros => arhos-*  (waiting)\n-  *cyrraedd => cyrhaedd-*  (arriving at)\n-  *dal => dali-* (catching)\n-  *gorffen=> gorffenn-*  (finishing)\n-  *gadael => gadaw-*  (leaving)\n-  *gwrando => gwrandaw-* (listening)\n-  *mwynhau => mwynha-* or *mwynheu-* (enjoying)\n\n(For other stems, check in, for example, www.gweiadur.com , or *Y Llyfr Berfau* (by Geraint Lewis).)\n\n**Note** that there are some dialect variations of some of these stems.\n\n----\nThe past endings are added to the stem:\n\n-  *-ais i* - I  [sometimes = *-es i*\n-  *-aist ti* - you (informal singular) [sometimes = *-est ti*]\n-  *-odd e/o/hi/Siân/y plant* - he/she/Siân/the children\n-  *-on ni* - we\n-  *-och chi* - you (formal, plural)\n-  *-on nhw* - they\n\nFor example, with *canu* (singing, stem *can-*):\n\n-  *Can- + -ais => Canais i* - I sang\n-  *Canaist ti* - you sang\n-  *Canodd e/hi/Siân/y plant* - he/she/Siân/the children sang\n-  *Canon ni* - we sang\n-  *Canoch chi* - you sang\n-  *Canon nhw* - they sang\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Siaradais i â Siân* - I spoke to Siân\n-  *Cerddais i gyda Siôn* - I walked with Siôn\n-  *Gwelon ni gathod* - We saw some cats\n-  *Mi welodd y cathod ni* - The cats saw us\n-  *Darllenoch chi lyfrau ddoe* - You read some books yesterday\n-  *Mwynhaoch chi'r ddrama.* - You enjoyed the play\n-  *Mi ddalion nhw'r trên.* - They caught the train.\n\n**Note** that short form verbs cause a soft mutation of their **object**.\n\n-  *Mi brynodd o **l**yfr.* - He bought a book *(llyfr)*\n-  *Gwylion nhw **r**aglen* - They watched a programme *(rhaglen)*\n\n----\n####Questions\n\nThe verb takes a soft mutation if possible, otherwise it's just intonation.  (*Mi* is never used before a question):\n\n-  *Siaradais i â Siân?* - Did I speak to Siân?\n-  *Gerddais i gyda Siôn?* - Did I walk with Siôn?\n-  *Welon ni gathod* - Did we see any cats?\n-  *Ddarllenoch chi lyfrau ddoe?* - Did you read any books yesterday?\n\nThe answers in this tense are simple:\n\n-  *do* - yes (I did)\n-  *naddo* - no (I did not)\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nWe mutate the verb (mixed mutation, aspirate if possible, otherwise soft), as in the present or future short forms) and add ***ddim***.  The *ddim* takes the soft mutation as an adverb or as the start of the object of the verb:\n\n-  *Siaradais i ddim â Siân* - I didn't talk to Siân\n-  *Cherddais i ddim gyda Siôn* - I didn't walk with Siôn\n-  *Welon ni ddim cathod* - We did not see any cats\n-  *Ddarllenoch chi ddim llyfrau ddoe* - You didn't read any books yesterday\n\n----\nWe cannot use *ddim* followed by anything definite - a proper noun, a pronoun, *'r/yr/y* (the), etc, and so *o* is used between them, giving the combination *mo*:\n\n-  *ddim + o => mo*\n-  *Welais i mo Siân.* - I did not see Siân.\n\n*mo* is followed by a soft mutation, just like *o*:\n\n-  *Welais i mo'i llyfr hi.* - I did not see her book.\n-  *Welodd Siân mo'r cathod.* - Siân did not see the cats.\n-  *Anfonodd o mo'r llythyr at Eleri.* - He didn't send the letter to Eleri.\n-  *Chyrhaeddon ni mo **G**aerdydd ddoe.* - We did not reach Cardiff yesterday.\n-  *Thalon ni mo **f**il Sioned.* - We did not pay Sioned's bill.\n-  *Welodd e mo **d**ŷ fy modryb.* - He did not see my aunt's house.\n-  *Thalodd e mo'u dyled.* - He did not pay their debt.\n\n----","urlName":"Past-Short-1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":35,"id":"b524a5ceeb2145490dd597aa29af6ae9","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Must&MustNot","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Must & Not","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Must\n\nTo say that somebody  **must** or **has to** to do something in English is expressed with the pattern ***rhaid i...*** in Welsh.\n\nThe standard pattern in the colloquial language is ***Rhaid i*** followed by a pronoun or proper name, followed by a verb-noun with soft mutation.\n\n-  *Rhaid i fi **f**ynd.* - I have to go, I must go.\n-  *Rhaid i Dylan **f**wyta.* - Dylan must eat.\n-  *Rhaid i chi **f**wydo Dylan.* - You must feed Dylan.\n-  *Rhaid i ni **dd**effro Dylan.* - We must wake Dylan up.\n\n####Mae rhaid...\nSometimes *Mae...* appears in front of *rhaid*. This is generally omitted in colloquial Welsh unless you want to emphasise the phrase:\n\n-  *Mae rhaid i Eleri dalu.* - Eleri has to pay.\n\n----\nSome pronouns cause changes to the preposition **’i’**\n\n|                  English         |                *Welsh*                   |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |\n|    I must go  |       *Rhaid **i fi/mi** fynd*         |\n|    You (sing.) must go  |       *Rhaid **i ti** fynd*         |\n|           He must go        | *Rhaid **iddo fe/fo** fynd* |\n|           She must go       |     *Rhaid **iddi hi** fynd*    |\n|           We must go        |         *Rhaid **i ni** fynd*      |\n|    You (plural) must go |       *Rhaid **i chi** fynd*     |\n|         They must go       | *Rhaid **iddyn nhw** fynd* |\n\n----\n####Questions\n\nThe question begins with ***Oes*** \n\nDo you have to go? = ***Oes rhaid i chi fynd?*** (literally - Is there a necessity for you to go?)\n\n-  The positive answer is ***Oes*** \n-  The negative answer is ***Nac oes***\n\n-  *Oes rhaid i Eleri dalu? Oes/Nac oes.* - Must Eleri pay? Yes. (she must)\n-  *Oes rhaid iddyn nhw ymadael nawr? Oes.* - Do they have to leave now?  Yes. (they must)\n\nIf you want to emphasies what they must do, use *Oes, **mae** rhaid ...*:\n\n-  *Oes rhaid iddyn nhw fynd nawr?  Oes, mae rhaid iddyn nhw fynd nawr neu byddan nhw'n colli'r trên adre.* - Do they have to go now?  Yes, they must go now or they will miss the train home.\n\n----\n####Two negatives - 'Don't have to' and 'Must not'\n\n#####Don't have to\nThis negative starts with **Does dim rhaid ...** and corresponds to **... don't have to ...**:\n \n-  *Does dim rhaid i chi fynd.* - You don’t have to go.\n-  *Does dim rhaid i Eleri dalu.* - Eleri doesn't have to pay.\n\n#####Must not\nAnother negative phrase **...must not...** has a completely different meaning and is written in a different way.  Here, we use **peidio â/ag**, with the meaning 'to not do' something.  (*ag* is used before a vowel):\n\n-  *Rhaid i chi **beidio â** mynd.*  - You must not go.  (literally - 'You must **refrain from** going')\n-  *Rhaid i chi **beidio ag** yfed.* - You must not drink.\n\n**Note** that *peidio* takes a soft mutation after the *rhaid i...* pattern.\n\n**Note** that the preposition *â* causes an aspirate mutation of a following word beginning with *p, t, c*:\n\n-  *Rhaid iddyn nhw beidio **â ch**erdded adre.* - They must not walk home.  *(cerdded)*\n-  *Rhaid iddo fe beidio **â th**alu'r tro 'ma.* - He mustn't pay this time.  *(talu)*\n-  *Rhaid i ti beidio **â ph**rynu anrhegion.* - You must not buy any presents.  *(prynu)*\n\nYou will come across the *â/ag* being dropped in casual speech and writing, in which case there is no adpirate mutation:\n\n-  *Rhaid iddo fe beidio talu.* - He must not pay.\n\n----\n####Other uses of *i fi, i ti, iddi hi, etc* in the *i-dot* patterns\n\nThere are many other patterns which use *i fi* and so on to create various meanings.  We introduce one here which means 'since I, you, they, etc did something'.  Note that the verb-noun that follows takes a soft mutation just as with the *rhaid i...* pattern:\n\n-  *Ers i ti **f**ynd dw i wedi colli dy rif ffôn.* - Since you went I have lost your phone number.\n-  *Ers iddo fe **b**rynu'r car newydd, mae o wedi cael llawer o hwyl.* - Since he bought the new car, he has had a lot of fun.\n\n**Note** that if there is no following verb-noun, there is no use of *i*:\n\n-  *Dw i ddim wedi gweld Dewi **ers mis Mai**.* - I have not seen Dewi **since May**.\n-  *Dydy hi ddim bod i Aber ers ei phen-blwydd.* - She has not been to Aber since her birthday.\n\n----","urlName":"MustMustNot"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":18,"id":"341f7dd4df742c6146d0453e1d98ec60","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Order","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Order","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####A simple sequence of events\n\n'Before I did this, we did that'.  'After doing one thing, I will do another'.  'Before I go somewhere, they will do something'.  These are all examples of simple sequences of events.\n\nIn this unit, the words ***cyn*** and ***ar ôl*** are taught, meaning *before* and *after*:\n\n-  *cyn mynd* - before going\n-  *ar ôl bwyta* - after eating.\n\nThese phrases are \"tenseless\" - that is to say that when translating them, it is some other part of the sentence which will point to the tense of the whole expression.  For example:\n\n-  *Ar ôl codi, ces i gawod.* - After getting up, I had a shower\n\nWhen they are used in a pattern saying that somebody does or did, etc something before or after something else, they are used in a pattern that is similar to *rhaid i* ('must'), using *i fi, i ti, iddo fe* and so on.   \n\n**Note** that this pattern, the '*i-dot* pattern', is common in Welsh in a variety of contexts.  It has been covered earlier in the course with *rhaid i...* and *ers i...*.\n\n**Remember** that the *i-dot* pattern is followed by a soft mutation of the verb-noun.\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Ar ôl i fi **g**odi, est ti i'r siop.* - After I had got up, you went to the shop.\n\nIn this example, *est ti*, (the past tense of *mynd*, 'going, to go') meaning 'you went', will mean that the action *codi* was also in the past.  It cannot be * 'After I get up, you went to the shop' as the tenses are mismatched - the sequence makes no sense.\n\n-  *Cyn i fi fynd i'r gwely, siaradais i â Siôn yn Gymraeg* - Before I went to bed, **I spoke**  to Siôn in Welsh.\n\nIn this example, the *siaradais i* (being in the past tense) meaning \"I spoke\" will mean that the *fynd* is translated as \"went\". Again, this sentence cannot be translated as * 'Before I go to bed, I spoke Welsh' as the tenses don't match up.\n\n-  *Symudoch chi i Gymru cyn i chi gael y plant.* - **You moved** to Wales before you had the children. or **You had moved** to Wales before you had the children.\n\nIn that example, the governing tense is introduced first - 'you moved', in the past. It cannot be translated as \"You moved to Wales before you 'have the children' as the first part, 'you moved', tells you that *cyn i chi gael* needs to be translated as 'before you **had** (or **had had**) the children'.\n\n**Note** that we do not use *yn* or *wedi* in these *i*-clauses.\n\nIf there is no pronoun, we just use *i*:\n\n-  *cyn i Dewi fynd* - before Dewi goes/went/had gone\n-  *Cyn **i** Sioned ddod i Aber, roedd hi'n byw yn Llanidloes.* - Before Sioned came to Aber she was living in Llanidloes.\n-  *Cyn **i** Dewi fynd, rhaid iddo fe dalu'r bil.* - Before Dewi goes, he has to pay the bill.\n-  *Ar ôl **i** Dewi orffen y gwaith, bydd e'n mynd adre.* - After Dewi finishes the work, he will go home.\n\n----\nSimilarly, when moving from English to Welsh:\n\n-  'Before we moved to Aber, we lived in Rhos' \n\nmeans that 'we lived in Rhos' can be translated in the imperfect:\n\n-  *...ro'n ni'n byw yn Rhos* \n\nThere is no tense in the *cyn i ni...* pattern itself, so the sentence becomes simply:\n\n-  *Cyn i ni symud i Aber, ro'n ni'n byw yn Rhos*\n\nNow consider 'Before we move to Aber, we **will** visit Patagonia'.  *Cyn i ni symud...* stays the same - no tense in the expression - and it is just the 'visiting' which needs to be put into the future:\n\n-  *Cyn i ni symud i Aber, **byddwn ni**'n ymweld â Phatagonia* - Before we move to Aber, we will visit Patagonia.\n\nWith the past again:\n\n-  *Cyn i ni symud i Aber, **ro'n i wedi gweithio** ym Mangor* - Before we moved to Aber, **I had worked** in Bangor.\n\nOn its own then, a phrase such as *cyn i ni symud* could translate as 'before we moved', 'before we had moved' or as 'before we move' - all are potentially correct until the phrase is put next to one with a tense in it.\n\n----","urlName":"Order"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":22,"id":"b4cc21aaa48e22b997d9380e977fd7c6","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Commands 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Commands 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Giving commands\n\n*Cymraeg*, along with many other European languages, has separate command forms of the verb.\n\nFirstly, we have to identify the stem of the verb.  Looking at the basic for of the verb, the 'verb-noun', as found in dictionaries, we can, in general, remove the following endings if they are present:\n\n-  *-a, -i, -o, -u, -eg, -ed, -an, -yd, -yll*\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *bwyta -> bwyt-*\n-  *coginio -> cogini-*\n-  *canu -> can-*\n-  *rhedeg -> rhed-*\n-  *cerdded -> cerdd-*\n\nIf the word does not end with one of those endings, the stem is usually the same as the basic form\n\n-  *chwarae -> chwarae-*\n-  *edrych -> edrych-*\n-  *eistedd -> eistedd-*\n-  *deall -> deall-*\n\nOnce we have the stem, we generally add one of two endings to give us the command form:\n\n-  ***-a*** is added for the familiar, singular *ti* form\n-  ***-wch*** is added for the plural or formal *chi* form\n\nThis section of the course practises the plural or formal *-wch* form.\n\nFor convenience on this course, we will generally add an exclamation mark after the commands to make them easier to identify.  For example:\n\n-  *bwyta!, bwytwch!* - eat!\n-  *coginia!, coginiwch!* - cook!\n-  *cana!, canwch!* - sing!\n-  *rheda!, rhedwch!* - run!\n-  *cerdda!, cerddwch!* - walk!\n\n----\nThere are several more detailed rules for finding stems and there are some irregular command forms too.  Here are some common ones:\n\n-  *aros (arhos-) - arhosa!, arhoswch!* - wait!\n-  *ennill (enill-) - enilla!, enillwch!* - win!\n-  *gorffen (gorffenn-) - gorffenna!; gorffennwch!* - finish!\n-  *gweld (gwel-) - gwela!, gwelwch!* - see!\n-  *sefyll (saf-) - saf!; sefwch!* - stand up!\n-  *troi (tro-) - tro!, trowch!* - turn!\n\nAnd very importantly, these irregular command forms:\n\n-  *bod - bydd!; byddwch!* - be!\n-  *mynd - cer/dos!; cerwch/ewch!* - go!\n-  *dod - dere/tyrd/ty'd!; dewch/dowch!* - come!\n-  *gwneud - gwna!; gwnewch!* - do!, make!\n\n**Note** that *cael* has no command forms.\n\nOther exceptional forms will come up from time to time in the course,  so keep an eye on the pop-up hints.  For example:\n\n-  *gwrando (gwrandaw-) - gwranda!, gwrandewch!* - listen!\n\n----\n####Soft mutation after a command\n\nThe command forms are short-form verbs, so if they are followed by an object, that object takes a soft mutation, as usual:\n\n-  *Dwedwch **r**ywbeth!* - Say something! *(rhywbeth)*\n-  *Darllena **l**yfr!* - Read a book! *(llyfr)*\n\n----\n####Telling someone **not** to do something\n\nWe can tell somebody to eat their vegetables - *Bwytwch eich llysiau!* - but we often need to tell someone not to do something, too.\n\n*Paid!* and *Peidiwch!* are command forms from the verb-noun *peidio* ('to refrain from') and we use those as negative commands:\n\n-  *Peidiwch â bwyta'r glo!* - Don't eat the coal!\n-  *Peidiwch â bwyta'r madarch 'na!* - Don't eat those mushrooms!\n\n**Note** that *Paid â...!* and *Peidiwch â...!* are translated into English as 'Don't...!' or 'Do not...!, (not as * 'Refrain from...!')\n\n*Peidio* and its forms are followed by the preposition *â*, although it is often omitted in casual speech.

Looking at the basic for of the verb, the 'verb-noun', as found in dictionaries, we can, in general, remove the following ending if they are present:\n\n-  *-a, -i, -o, -u, -eg, -ed, -an, -yd, -yll*\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *bwyta -> bwyt-*\n-  *coginio -> cogini-*\n-  *canu -> can-*\n-  *rhedeg -> rhed-*\n-  *cerdded -> cerdd-*\n\nIf the word does not end with one of those endings, the stem is usually the same as the basic form\n\n-  *chwarae -> chwarae-*\n-  *edrych -> edrych-*\n-  *eistedd -> eistedd-*\n-  *deall -> deall-*\n\n----\nOnce we have the stem, we generally add one of two endings to give us the command form:\n\n-  ***-a*** is added for the familiar, singular form\n-  ***-wch*** is added for the plural or formal form\n\nThis section of the course practises the familar *-a* form.\n\nFor convenience on this course, we will generally add an exclamation mark after the commands to make them easier to identify.  For example:\n\n-  *bwyta!, bwytwch!* - eat!\n-  *coginia!, coginiwch!* - cook!\n-  *cana!, canwch!* - sing!\n-  *rheda!, rhedwch!* - run!\n-  *cerdda!, cerddwch!* - walk!\n\nThere are several more detailed rules for finding stems and there are some irregular command forms too.  Here are some common ones:\n\n-  *aros (arhos-) - arhosa!, arhoswch!* - wait!\n-  *ennill (enill-) - enilla!, enillwch!* - win!\n-  *gorffen (gorffenn-) - gorffenna!; gorffennwch!* - finish!\n-  *gweld (gwel-) - gwela!, gwelwch!* - see!\n-  *gwrando (gwrandaw-) - gwranda!, gwrandewch!* - listen!\n-  *sefyll (saf-) - saf!; sefwch!* - stand up!\n-  *troi (tro-) - tro!, trowch!* - turn!\n\nAnd very importantly, these irregular command forms:\n\n-  *bod - bydd!; byddwch!* - be!\n-  *mynd - cer/dos!; cerwch/ewch!* - go!\n-  *dod - dere/tyrd/ty'd!; dewch/dowch!* - come!\n-  *gwneud - gwna!; gwnewch!* - do!, make!\n\n**Note** that *cael* has no command forms.\n\nOther exceptional forms will come up from time to time in the course,  so keep an eye on the pop-up hints.  For example:\n\n-  *gwrando (gwrandaw-) - Gwranda! Gwrandewch!* - Listen!\n\n----\n####Soft mutation after a command\n\nThe command forms are short-forms verbs, so if they are followed by an object, that object takes a soft mutation, as usual:\n\n-  *Dwedwch **r**ywbeth!* - Say something! *(rhywbeth)*\n-  *Darllena **l**yfr!* - Read a book! *(llyfr)*\n\n----\n####Telling someone **not** to do something\n\nWe can tell somebody to eat their vegetables - *Bwyta dy lysiau!* - but we often need to tell someone not to do something, too.\n\n*Paid!* and *Peidiwch!* are command forms from the verb-noun *peidio* (to refrain from) and we use those as negative commands:\n\n-  *Paid â bwyta'r glo!* - Don't eat the coal!\n-  *Paid â bwyta'r madarch 'na!* - Don't eat those mushrooms!\n\n**Note** that *Paid â...!* and *Peidiwch â...!* are translated into English as 'Don't...!' or 'Do not...!, (not as * 'Refrain from...!')\n\n*Peidio* and its forms are followed by the preposition *â*, although it is often omitted in casual speech.  Where it is used, *â* is followed by an aspirate mutation of *p-, t-, c-*:\n\n-  *Paid â phrynu...!* - Don't buy...!  *(prynu)*\n-  *Paid â thalu...!* - Don't pay...!  *(talu)*\n-  *Paid â chwyno am...!* - Don't complain about...!  *(cwyno)*\n\n**Remember that*â* changes to *ag* before vowels:\n\n-  *Paid ag edrych i lawr!* - Don't look down!\n\nAs you would expect from the endings, *paid â!* is the informal singular form, and *peidiwch â* is the formal or plural form.\n\n----\n####Not all words get translated one-for-one between English and Welsh\n\nThis is a convenient place to mention that not all words get translated one-for-one between English and Welsh.  Here are some examples:\n\n-  *sefyll* - to stand (up), standing (up),  - no need for a separate word for 'up' in the Welsh\n-  *eistedd* - to sit (down), sitting (down)\n-  *trowch i'r chwith/dde* - turn (to the) left/right (the 'to the' is optional in the English)\n-  *mynd heibio i* - go past (the *i* is usual in the Welsh)\n-  *gyferbyn â* - opposite (the *â* is not translated)\n-  *mynd â* - to take, taking\n-  *dod â* - to bring, bringing\n\n----\n\nTo read more about command forms, visit [this site](http://clwbmalucachu.co.uk/cmc/cheat/cheat_commands.htm).","urlName":"Commands2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"b1b5e6ec752c7345387f4158d801ca90","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Revise and Extend 2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"RevEx 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\nThe aim of this section is to revise patterns already covered, to extend their application, and to introduce additional vocabulary.\n\n----\n####Newydd - has/have just\n\nEarlier in the course you met the use of *wedi* to say that you 'have done' something:\n\n-  *Dw i wedi cyrraedd yr ysgol* - I have arrived at school.\n\nTo say that we have just done something, we can simply replace the *wedi* with *newydd* followed by a soft mutation of the verb-noun:\n\n-  *Dw i newydd **g**yrraedd yr ysgol.* - I have just arrived at school.\n-  *Dw i newydd **b**rynu beic.* - I have just bought a bike.\n-  *Ydy Dewi newydd **dd**od adre?* - Has Dewi just come home?\n-  *Ydy Mair yn mynd allan heno?

An adjective placed in front of a noun causes a soft mutation of the noun.  Common ones include:\n\n-  *hen* (old): *yr hen **dd**yn* - the old man\n-  *prif* (chief, main): *y Prif **G**wnstable* - the Chief Constable\n-  *holl* (whole):  *yr holl **d**eisen* - the whole cake\n-  *ychydig* - little/small amount: *ychydig **f**wyd* - a little food; a small amount of food\n\n----\n####'Weak' soft mutation after *yn*\n\nRemember the use of the soft mutation after *yn* when it is used to introduce an adjective:\n\n-  *Mae e**'n d**enau* - He is thin *(tenau)*\n-  *Roedd Siân yn rhedeg **yn g**yflym* - Siân used to run fast *(cyflym)*\n-  *Mae'r gerddi**'n b**reifat* - The gardens are private *(preifat)*\n\n**But note** that this use of *yn* does not cause soft mutation in words beginning with the letters *ll-* or *rh-*:\n\n-  *Mae Siôn yn byw**'n ll**eol* - Siôn lives locally\n-  *Bydd y theatr **yn ll**awn heno* - The theatre will be full tonight\n-  *Roedden nhw'n mynd i'r dafarn **yn rh**y aml* - They used to go to the pub too often\n-  *Dydy'r bwyty 'na ddim **yn rh**ad o gwbl!* - That restaurant isn't cheap at all!\n\nThis particular soft mutation, where *ll-* and *rh-* resist the soft mutation, is sometimes known as the 'weak soft mutation'.  Although it does not apply to many situations, some of these are quite common, although you may not have met all of them yet. It applies to:\n\n-  *y* (the) in front of feminine nouns.\n-  *un* (one) in front of feminine nouns.\n-  *yn* when introducing nouns and adjectives.\n-  *mor, cyn*, but only where these mean 'as' or 'so' in front of adjectives.\n\n----\n####What do you think of...\n\nWe are often asked what we think of or about things.  The usual construction in Welsh is to use *meddwl + o*.  Note that *meddwl* should be mutated in this pattern following *Beth...?* or *Be ...?* (although not everybody remembers to do so!) and the *ei* that causes it may occasionally be left in, especially in writing:\n\n-  *Beth wyt ti'n feddwl o'r etholiad?* - What do you think of/about the election? \n-  *Beth oeddech chi'n feddwl o Ceri Lingo fel Prif Weinidog?* - What did you think of Ceri Lingo as First Minister?\n-  *Be fyddan nhw'n feddwl o Dewi fel eu cynghorydd?* - What will they think of Dewi as their councillor?\n-  *Beth fydd eich mab yn ei feddwl o'ch tŷ newydd?* - What will your son think of your new house?\n-  *Be fydd Siân yn feddwl o lythyr Dewi?* -  What will Siân think about Dewi's letter?\n\n**Note** that when talking about what people thought about something in the past (what **did** they think) we   usually use the imperfect (*beth **oedden nhw**'n ei feddwl o...*) rather than the simple past.  This is because 'thinking about' tends to be a continuing, longer lasting process than just a one-off event such as 'going to somewhere'.\n\n**Note** that we use *meddwl o* when asking about or giving an opinion, but *meddwl am*, when, say, thinking about doing something:\n\n-  *Maen nhw'n meddwl **am** symud tŷ'n fuan* - They are thinking about moving house soon.\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **am** ymarfer fy Ngymraeg heno yn lle defnyddio Saesneg gymaint* - I am thinking about practising my Welsh this evening instead of using English so much.\n\n----\n####What sort of place was it?  What is someone like?\nWe have seen *sut?* with a verb so far, causing no mutation, and meaning simply 'How...?:\n\n-  *Sut mae hi?* - How is she?\n-  *Sut mae?* - How are you?  How are things?  - as a greeting\n-  *Sut roedd eich gwyliau?* - How were your holidays?\n-  *Sut prynoch chi'ch car newydd?* - How did you buy your new car?\n\nWe can also use it in front of a noun or a name to ask 'What sort of place/person is xxx?'  'What is xxx like?'  In this case, *sut* causes a soft mutation if it comes directly before a noun:\n\n-  *Sut **l**e ydy Aber?* - What sort of a place is Aber?  What is Aber like? *(lle -> **l**e)*\n-  *Sut un ydy Dewi Lingo?* - What is Dewi Lingo like?\n-  *Sut **b**erson ydy Hefin?* - What sort of a person is Hefin? *(person -> **b**erson)*\n-  *Sut un yw'r tŷ 'na?* - What is that house like?\n-  *Sut roedd y tywydd yn Aber ddoe?* - What was the weather like in Aber yesterday?\n\n----\n####An example of a fixed expression - *gyda'r nos*\n\nWelsh has many idiomatic or fixed expressions where a literal translation does not help to understand the actual meaning.  One that is very widely used all over Wales is:\n\n-  *gyda'r nos* - in the evening; evening\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Mae o'n hoffi mynd allan gyda'r nos.* - He likes to go out in the evening.\n-  *Ydy'r siop ar agor gyda'r nos?* - Is the shop open in the evening?\n-  *Roedd Sam allan drwy'r gyda'r nos.* - Sam was out all evening.\n\n----","urlName":"Opinions"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":8,"id":"be1613798524d36059a4aae89559d059","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Money","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Money","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Money\nThe monetary units in British currency, *punt* (pound) and *ceiniog* (penny), are feminine nouns in Welsh, so we use the feminine versions of the numbers two, three and four for money:\n\n-  *dwy geiniog, dwy bunt* - two pence, two pounds\n-  *tair ceiniog, tair punt* - three pence, three pounds\n-  *pedair ceiniog, pedair punt* - four pence, four pounds\n\n\nSince there is no indefinite article 'a' in Welsh, a sentence like '£10 (ten pounds) a bottle' is translated in Welsh as *£10 **y** botel*.\n\n-  *Faint yw'r losin?  Dau ddeg ceiniog y pecyn.* - How much are the sweets?  Twenty pence a packet.\n-  *Mae'r tatws 'ma'n costio punt y cilo.* - These potatoes cost a pound a kilo.\n-  *Mae'r tatws 'na'n yn costio pum deg ceiniog y pwys.* - Those potatoes cost fifty pence a pound.\n\nTo say that you can buy something for some amount of  money, use *am*:\n\n-  *Mae e'n gwerthu y gadair **am** bunt.* He is selling the chair **for** a pound.\n-  *Mae e'n talu pum punt **am** y cloc.* - He is paying five pounds for the clock.\n\n**Note** that:\n\n-  *punt* is a pound (£) currency (feminine noun)\n-  *pwys* is a pound (lb) weight (masculine noun)\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Mae'r tatws 'na'n costio pedair punt am bedwar pwys!* - Those potatoes cost four pounds for four pounds!  (£4 for 4lbs)\n\n####Plurals - *punnau* and *punnoedd*\n\nIt is quite acceptable these days to use the singular *punt* with larger amounts of money:\n\n-  *dau ddeg punt* - twenty pounds\n-  *pedwar deg pedair punt* - forty-four pounds\n\nHowever, it is also still common to use the plurals *punnau* (with *o*, usually for specific amounts) and *punnoedd* (usually for non-specific amounts, but otherwise with *o*, too).  \n\n**Note** that the feminine forms of the final part of the numbers are used when they are followed by *o bunnau*:\n\n-  *dau ddeg **tair** o bunnau* - twenty-three pounds\n-  *pedwar deg **pedair** o bunnau* - forty-four pounds\n-  *Gwnes i wario cant o bunnau ddoe.* - I spent a hundred pounds yesterday. (a definite amount)\n-  *Mae hwnna'n werth miloedd o bunnoedd!* - That's worth thousands of pounds! (an indefinite amount)\n-  *Mae e'n gwario degau o bunnoedd ar barcio bob wythnos.* - He spends tens of pounds on parking every week. (an indefinite amount)\n\nTraditional 20-based numbers may also still be seen occasionally:\n\n-  *ugain o bunnau* - twenty pounds\n-  *deugain o bunnau* - forty pounds\n-  *hanner cant o bunnau* - fifty pounds\n-  *trigain o bunnau* - sixty pounds\n-  *pedwar ugain o bunnau* - eighty pounds\n-  *pedwar ar bymtheg a phedwar ugain o bunnau* - ninety-nine pounds\n\nThis last example is perhaps why people are now much more keen to use the newer decimal system of numbering for day-to-day purposes!\n\n----\n####Other currencies\nFor other currencies we have:\n\n-  *Doler a sent* - Dollar and cent\n-  *Ewro a sent* - Euro and cent\n\nBoth *doler* and *sent* are feminine nouns and so will use the feminine numbers above.  *Ewro* is a masculine noun so will use masculine numbers.\n\n-  *Pedair doler pedair sent* - $4.04\n-  *Pedwar ewro pedair sent* - €4.04\n\n----\n####This, these, that and those\nOften, we will want to ask 'How much is that?', 'How much are those?'.  These are the words to use:\n\n-  *hwn* -  this one, this (masculine/indeterminate)\n-  *hon* - this one, this (feminine)\n-  *hwnna, hwnnw* - that one, that (masculine/indeterminate)\n-  *honno* - that one, that (feminine)\n-  *y rhain* - these, these ones\n-  *y rheina* - those, those ones\n\n-  *Faint ydy'r rhain?* - How much are these?\n-  *Faint yw hon?* - How much is this one?  (something which you know if feminine - *sgert, cath, cadair,...*)\n-  *Faint yw'r rheina?*  How much are those?\n-  *Faint bydd y rheina fis nesaf?* - How much will those be next month?\n-  *Beth yw hwn?* - What's this? (something of indeterminate gender)\n\nThere are some variants of these, especially in some dialects and in more formal writing.\n\nThe *h-* words can also be used as demonstrative adjectives:\n\n-  *y ci hwn; y ci 'ma* - this dog\n-  *y gath hon, y gath 'ma* - this cat\n-  *y ci hwnnw; y ci 'na* - that dog\n-  *y gath honno; y gath 'na* - that cat\n\n----\nThere are other words that we use for intangibles, abstract concepts that we cannot physically touch:\n\n-  *hyn* - this\n-  *hynny* - that\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Mae hyn yn wir* - This is true\n-  *Doedd hynny ddim yn glyfar iawn!* - That wasn't very clever!\n-  *Dydy hyn/hynny ddim yn deg* - This/That isn't fair.\n-  *Mae hyn yn anodd!  Nac ydy, mae hynny'n anos o lawer!* - This is difficult!  No it isn't, that's much harder!\n\n**Note** that as demonstrative adjectives they can used with plurals:\n\n-  *y llyfrau 'ma; y llyfrau hyn* - these books\n-  *y llyfrau 'na; y llyfrau hynny* - those books\n\n----","urlName":"Money"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":10,"id":"51f03bb1d19091c4c8d8445ebdba993f","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Health","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Health","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Being ill\n\nThe way of asking if someone is ill in Welsh is to say:\n\n-  *Beth sy'n bod arnoch chi?* - What's the matter with you? \n-  *Beth sy'n bod arnat ti?* - What's the matter with you?\n\n----\nIf you have a generalised illness such as a cold, the standard pattern to use is:\n\n-  *Mae annwyd arna i.* - I have a cold\n\n**Note** that in northern dialects the possessive pattern with *gan* is used rather than using *ar*.  The *gan, etc* comes before the noun:\n\n-  *Mae gen i annwyd*.\n\nIf you have a specific localised pain, such as sore throat, the answer is similar to the natural English sentence and we use *gyda* or *gan*, as in the Welsh possessive patterns. (This pattern is also used for a generalised illness in northern dialects):\n\n- *Mae gwddw tost gyda fi* or *Mae gen i ddolur gwddw* - I have a sore throat.\n\n**Note** that in the second phrase, the *gen i* has come between the *mae...* and the *dolur gwddw* and so it causes a mutation of *dolur* to *ddolur*.  This is the same cause of a soft mutation as was explained in the notes for 'Possession' earlier in the course.\n\nThe following ailments in *Cymraeg*, particularly where they affect the whole body or are some sort of internal infection, are usually **on** (ar) us instead of **with** *(gyda/gan)* us. (Not in northern dialects, though.) These include:\n\n-  *annwyd* - a cold\n-  *peswch* - a cough\n-  *gwres* - a temperature\n-  *twymyn* - a fever\n-  *y ddannoedd/ddannodd* - toothache\n-  *feirws* - a virus\n-  *haint* - a bug\n-  *y ffliw* - the flu\n\n----\nA conjugation of *ar* is needed for each pronoun and works like this:\n\n| English | Cymraeg | Example | Translation |\n|-||||\n|I have|*Mae ... arna i*|*Mae annwyd arna i*|I have a cold|\n|You have|*Mae ... arnat ti*|*Mae peswch arnat ti*|You have a cough|\n|He has|*Mae ... arno fe/fo*|*Mae'r ddannodd arno fe/fo*|He has toothache|\n|She has|*Mae ... arni hi*|*Mae feirws arni hi*|She has a virus|\n|We have|*Mae ... arnon ni*|*Mae haint arnon ni*|We have a bug|\n|You have|*Mae ... arnoch chi*|*Mae gwres arnoch chi*|You have a temperature|\n|They have|*Mae ... arnyn nhw*|*Mae annwyd arnyn nhw*|They have a cold|\n|Siân has|*Mae ... ar Siân*|*Mae peswch ar Siân*|Siân has a cough|\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Mae annwyd arnoch chi.* - You have a cold.\n-  *Mae'r ffliw arnyn nhw.* - They have got the flu.\n-  *Mae'r ddannodd ofnadwy arna i.* - I have terrible toothache.\n-  *Mae gwres ar Siân.* - Siân's got a temperature.\n\nBut in northern dialects:\n\n-  *Mae gan Siân wres.* - Siân has got a temperature. \n\n----\nAsking questions about health\n\nWith many diseases and complaints we can simply ask about their existence by using *Oes...?* as usual when asking about the existence of indefinite things:\n\n-  *Oes annwyd arnat ti?  Oes/Nac oes.* - Do you have a cold?  Yes/No.\n-  *Oes gwres ar Siân?  Oes/Nac oes.* - Has Siân got a temperature?  Yes/No.\n-  *Oes pen tost gyda fe?  Oes/Nac oes.* - Does he have a headache?  Yes/No.\n\nIn northern dialects:\n\n-  *Oes gen ti annwyd?  Oes/Nac oes.* - Do you have a cold?  Yes/No.\n-  *Oes gan Siân wres? Oes/Nac oes.* - Has Siân got a temperature?\n\nHowever, some diseases in Welsh usually come with a definite article, even though there may not be in English.  For example:\n\n-  *(y) ffliw* - (the) flu\n-  *y frech goch* - measles\n-  *clefyd y gwair* - hayfever\n-  *y ddannodd* - toothache\n\nWe do not use *Oes...?* as a question about definite things in Welsh, so we have to use *Ydy...?* with these 'definite' complaints instead:\n\n-  *Ydy'r ffliw arnoch chi? Ydy/Nac ydy.* - Have you got (the) flu?  Yes/No.\n-  *Ydy'r frech goch arnyn nhw?  Ydy/Nac ydy.* - Have they got measles?  Yes/No.\n-  *Ydy clefyd y gwair ar Sam heddiw?  Ydy/Nac ydy.* - Has Sam got hayfever today ? Yes/No.\n\n----\n####Alternative forms in parts of north Wales\n\nAs mentioned, in the 'north' versions of the *DysguCymraeg Mynediad* and *Sylfaen* courses, the preposition *gan* is taught instead of both *gyda* and *ar* for ailments and injuries, reflecting local usage.  The conjugation of *gan* was covered earlier in the course in 'Possession Gan'.  \n\nThere are also some different forms for some common ailments.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Mae gen i gur pen.* - I have a headache.\n-  *Mae gen ti boen bol.* - You have a stomache ache.\n-  *Roedd gynnoch chi beswch.* - You had a cough.\n-  *Oedd gen ti bigyn clust.* - Did you have earache?\n-  *Oes gynno fo ddolur gwddf?* - Does he have a sore throat?\n\nUnless there is a specific alternative form, *poen * is usually used:\n\n-  *poen braich* - a sore arm\n-  *poen bawd* - a sore thumb\n\nNote that there are also abbreviated forms.  For example:\n\n-  *Sgen i ddim annwyd.* - I do not have a cold.\n-  *Sgen ti ffliw?* - Have you got flu?\n-  *Sgynno fo ffliw?* - Does he have flu?\n-  *Sgynni hi boen clun?* - Has she got a sore hip?\n-  *Sgynni hi ddim dolur gwddw.* - She doesn't have a sore throat.\n- *etc*\n\n----","urlName":"Health"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":15,"id":"d1847dbd31d70b2f41333555bed123ed","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Can&When","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Can & When","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Being able to ...\nThe simplest way to express **'to be able'** or **'can'** is to use the verb-nouns ***gallu*** or ***medru***.\n\nThis is usually used with form of **bod** 'to be':\n\n-  *Dw i'n gallu...* - I am able to/I can...\n-  *Dych chi'n gallu...* - You are able to/You can...\n-  *Dw i ddim yn medru...* - I am not able to/I cannot...\n-  *Ydy e'n gallu...?* - Can he...?\n\nAdding another verb-noun directly after *gallu/medru* tells us what it is that the person can do:\n\n-  *Dw i'n gallu nofio'n gyflym.* - I can swim fast.\n-  *Byddi di'n gallu gyrru car yn fuan.* - You will soon be able to drive a car.\n-  *Roedd Siân yn medru sgïo'n dda iawn.* - Siân used to be able to ski very well.\n\nIn parts of north Wales, *medru* is often used instead of or alongside *gallu*:\n\n-  *Roedd o'n medru dringo'n dda.* - He used to be able to climb very well.\n-  *Doedd Eleri ddim yn medru coginio o gwbl.* - Eleri couldn't cook at all.\n-  *Dach chi'n medru gyrru lori?* - Can you drive a lorry?\n\n----\nWe can also ask what someone is able to do:\n\n-  *Beth dych chi'n gallu wneud?* - What can you do?\n\n**Note** that *gwneud* should be mutated in this construction.  This is because of an *ei* which is usually left out in colloquial speech:\n\n-  *Beth mae Siôn yn gallu (**ei**) wneud?* - What can Siôn do?\n\n**Note** that you will come across *Be?* as a shortened form of *Beth?*.\n\nAs the thing that we are asking about Siôn's ability to do is vague or indeterminate, the masculine gender is assumed for it, so the *ei* (masculine) causes a soft mutation of *gwneud*.\n\nNote that in this question *Beth...?* is followed by *mae*:\n\n-  *Beth bydda i'n gallu wneud yfory?* - What will I be able to do tomorrow?\n-  *Beth mae'r plant yn gallu wneud yn yr ardd nawr?* - What can the children do in the garden now?\n-  *Be mae hi'n medru wneud o bapur?* - What can she make out of paper?\n-  *Be mae Dewi'n medru wneud o'r bren 'na?* - What can Dewi make from that wood?\n\n----\n\n####Another accent or diacritic - the diaeresis, *y didolnod*\n\nWe have already met some words which use a vowel with a circumflex accent (*to bach* or *acen grom*) to show that the vowel is always pronounced as a long vowel:  *dŵr, tŷ, ffôn, gêm, ...*\n\nA less common but important accent is the *didolnod* (diaeresis or 'double dot'), which looks the same as a printed German umlaut.  In Welsh, it signifies that the vowel is to be pronounced as a separate long vowel in the emphasised syllable and not as part of a diphthong.  Some examples:\n\n-  *sgïo* (skiing) - prounounced as *sgï-o*, with the emphasis on the *sgï-* and a long vowel.\n-  *Gwenllïan* (a woman's name) - pronounced as *Gwen-llï-an*, with the emphasis on the *-llï-* with a long vowel.\n-  *gwnïo* (sewing) - pronounced as *gw-nï-o*, with the emphasis on the *-nï-* with a long vowel.\n-  *gweddïo* (praying) - pronounced as *gwe-ddï-o*, with the emphasis on *-ddï-* with a long vowel.\n\nIt can be quite hard to spot in some fonts, so be careful to look out for it.  Because it uses the same symbol as the umlaut, it is usually readily available on most keyboard layouts - just look on the web for how to get that accent on your particular device.  On phones and tablets it can usually be found by keeping the character key pressed for a short while until a pop-up menu of accented characters appears.  The same trick is usually available on MacOS keyboards, too.\n\n####Ever or never - *byth, erioed*\n\n*byth* and *erioed* are used to mean both 'ever' and 'never', depending on the context.  In a negative sentence they can be used in place of *ddim* to mean 'never'.  They are used with particular tenses:\n\n-  *erioed* is used with completed tenses in the past - the present perfect, the simple past and the pluperfect.\n-  *byth* is used with other tenses - the present, future, imperfect past and the conditional.\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Dyw hi byth yn mynd yno.  Dyw hi ddim yn mynd yno byth.* - She never goes there.\n-  *Doedd hi byth yn mynd yno.  Doedd hi ddim yn mynd yno byth.* - She never used to go there.\n-  *Fydd hi byth yn mynd yno.* - She will never go there.\n-  *Dyw hi erioed wedi bod yno.   Dyw hi ddim wedi bod yno erioed.* - She has never been there.\n-  *Aeth hi yno erioed?* - Did she ever go there?\n-  *Doedd hi erioed wedi bod yno.* - She had never been there.\n\n----","urlName":"CanWhen"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":13,"id":"57dd6ba5bf9af218f3b1e090f51656ea","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Describe1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Describe 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Soft mutation of adjectives following feminine nouns\n\n**Remember** that feminine nouns trigger soft mutation of following adjectives.  Also remember that the order is usually **noun, adjective**.

Instead, a special form is used - *sy*:\n\n-  *Pwy ydy'r athro?  Dewi ydy'r athro* - Who is the teacher?  Dewi is the teacher.\n-  *Pwy yw'r cogydd heddiw?  Hefin yw'r cogydd* - Who is the cook today?  Hefin is the cook.\n\nBut:\n\n-  *Pwy sy'n mynd i Aber? Siân sy'n mynd* - Who is going to Aber?  It's Siân who's going\n-  *Pwy sy'n ennill?

It's Dewi who cooked breakfast.\n-  *Pwy sy gyda **ch**ar coch?* - Who's got a red car?\n-  *Pwy sy gan **g**ath?* - Who has a cat?\n\n**Note** that *gyda* is followed by an aspirate mutation, and *gan* by a soft mutation.\n\nThis is also covered later in the course in the topic on 'Emphasis'.\n\n----\n####Which ...?\n\nThe question word most closely matching the English 'Which?' is *'Pa?*.  It can also be used for 'What?' in some contexts where there is a choice between one or more.  It is followed by a soft mutation.  Note that, like *Pwy?*, it must sometimes be followed by *sy* in the present tense:\n\n-  *Pa **g**rys wyt ti eisiau?* - Which shirt do you want?\n-  *Pa **l**iw oedd llygaid y gath?* - What colour were the cat's eyes?\n-  *Pa **l**yfr* oedd ar y bwrdd?* - Which book was on the table?\n-  *Pa **d**rên sy'n mynd i Aber?* - Which train goes to Aber?\n\nIt is also be used in the questions \"Which one?' *(Pa un, P'un)* and 'Which ones? *(Pa rai?)*:\n\n-  *Pa un fydd yn ennill?* - Which one will win?\n-  *Pa rai ydy'r gorau?* - Which ones are the best?\n-  *Pa rai wyt ti eisiau?* - Which ones do you want?\n-  *P'un sy'n mynd i Aber?* - Which one goes to Aber?\n\n----","urlName":"Describe1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"e3bc9d2aae10e57c627079a676de01a0","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"FutureBod","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Fut. Bod","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####The future tense of *bod*\n\nThis unit introduces the future tense of the verb *bod* (to be, being).\n\n----\nThe future tense of *bod* is used either on its own, to mean 'I will be', 'You will be', etc, or to help to form the future of other verbs such as 'I will be eating', 'You will be running', etc.\n\nHere are the future forms of *bod*:\n\n-  *Bydda i* - I will be\n-  *Byddi di* - You will be (**Note** that *ti* changes to *di* in the future tense)\n-  *Bydd e/o/hi/y plant* - He/She/The children will be\n-  *Byddwn ni* - We will be\n-  *Byddwch chi* - You will be\n-  *Byddan nhw* - They will be (**Note** that this form is only used with the pronoun *nhw*)\n\n----\nAs with the present tense of *bod*, the future of *bod* can be used with *'n/yn* and a verb-noun to create a future tense of other verbs:\n\n-  *Dw i'n bwyta* - I am eating, I eat\n-  *Bydda i'n bwyta* - I will be eating, I will eat.\n-  *Bydd y plant yn bwyta pysgod heno* - The children wil be eating fish this evening.\n-  *Byddwch chi'n mynd i Fangor yfory* - You'll be going to Bangor tomorrow\n-  *Byddan nhw'n ymweld â Siân ddydd Sul* - they will be visiting Siân on Sunday.\n\n----\n####Questions and answers\nWhen asking a question, the first letter of a verb takes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Fydda i?* - Will I be?\n-  *Fyddi di?* - Will you be?\n-  *Fydd e'n ymweld â Siân yfory?* - Will he be visiting Siân tomorrow?\n-  *Fyddan nhw'n codi'n gynnar yfory?* - Will they get up early tomorrow?\n\n----\nWhen answering 'Yes' we use the usual form of the positive statement, but without a pronoun.  \n\nWhen answering 'No', we use *Na...* + (mixed mutation) + the form of the statement:\n\n-  *Fydd hi'n mynd?  Bydd/Na fydd.* - Will she be going?  Yes/No.\n-  *Fyddan nhw'n ymweld â Siân yfory?  Byddan/Na fyddan.* - Will they be visiting Siân tomorrow?  Yes/No (they).\n-  *Fyddwch chi'n mwynhau'r parti?  Bydda/Na fydda; Byddwn/Na fyddwn.* - Will you enjoy the party?  Yes/No (I); Yes/No (we).\n-  *Fyddi di'n gwneud swper?  Bydda/Na fydda.* - Will you be making supper?  Yes/No (I).\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nTo negate a verb, the first letter takes a mixed mutation and *ddim* is added after the pronoun.  \n\nIn the mixed mutation:\n\n-  The letters *p-, t-, c-* take an aspirate mutation.\n-  The letters *b-, d-, g-, m-, ll-, rh-* take a soft mutation (since they cannot take an aspirate mutation).\n\nIn the case of the future of  *bod* this means that the *b-* takes a soft mutation to *f-*:\n\n-  *Fydda i ddim* - I will not be\n-  *Fyddi di ddim* - You will not be\n-  *Fydd e/o/hi/y plant ddim* - He/She/The children will not be\n-  *Fyddwn ni ddim* - We will not be\n-  *Fyddwch chi ddim* - You will not b \n-  *Fyddan nhw ddim* - They will not be \n\nSo:\n\n-  *Fydda i ddim yn mynd i'r parti heno* - I won't be going to the party tonight.\n-  *Fydd y plant ddim yn mynd i'r ysgol yfory* - The children will not be going to school tomorrow.\n-  *Fyddan nhw ddim yn mynd i'r parc, chwaith.* - They won't be going to the park, either.\n\n----\n####*Os* with the future tense\n\nIn English it is usual to use the present tense followed by the future tense in an if-statement such as 'If it rains tomorrow I will stay at home. In Welsh, though, use the future tense for both parts of the sentence:\n\n-  *Os **bydd** hi'n bwrw glaw yfory, **bydda** i'n aros gartre.* - If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.\n-  *Byddwn ni'n mynd i'r sinema yfory, os **bydd** digon o arian gyda ni.* - We will go to the cinema tomorrow, if we have enough money.\n\nThis is another example of where the two languages use different patterns and structures to convey the same meaning.\n\n----\n####Britishisms - revising, to revise\n\nIn British English, one of the common meanings of 'revising' is to go over previously learned materials in order to strengthen our knowledge of them.  For example, we might 'revise' our knowledge of the simple past tense of the main irregular verbs in advance of a Welsh exam.  In Welsh we use *adolygu* for this meaning of 'revising'.  It is not the same as 'studying' *(astudio)*.\n\n----","urlName":"FutureBod"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":36,"id":"86c6479d14eaf2806f0f9e6d9b53fe10","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Places2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Places 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Saying 'there'\nWelsh has several words for 'there' as in:\n\n-  I have been there, too.\n-  She goes there a lot.\n-  We'll meet there tomorrow.\n\nwhere 'there' is not necessarily specified in the sentence but perhaps has been mentioned earlier in the conversation.  Two common words are:\n\n-  *yna, 'na*  - where *'na* is just a common contraction of *yna*. \n-  *yno* \n\nWhile *yna/'na* is also used in other situations to mean 'then' or 'that', *yno* is only ever used to mean 'there'.\n\n-  *Es i yno y llynedd.* - I went there last year.\n-  *Mae hi'n mynd yno'n aml.* - She often goes there.\n-  *Byddwn ni'n cwrdd yno yfory.* - We'll meet there tomorrow.\n\n----\n####What sort of place was it?  What is someone like?\nWe have seen *sut?* with a verb so far, causing no mutation, and meaning simply 'How...?:\n\n-  *Sut mae hi?* - How is she?\n-  *Sut mae?* - How are you?  How are things?  - as a greeting\n-  *Sut roedd eich gwyliau?* - How were your holidays?\n-  *Sut prynoch chi'ch car newydd?* - How did you buy your new car?\n\nWe can also use it in front of a noun or a name to ask 'What sort of place/person is xxx?'  'What is xxx like?'  In this case, *sut* causes a soft mutation **if it comes directly before a noun**:\n\n-  *Sut **l**e ydy Aber?* - What sort of a place is Aber?  What is Aber like? *(lle -> **l**e)*\n-  *Sut un ydy Dewi Lingo?* - What is Dewi Lingo like?\n-  *Sut **b**erson ydy Hefin?* - What sort of a person is Hefin? *(person -> **b**erson)*\n-  *Sut un yw'r tŷ 'na?* - What is that house like?\n-  *Sut roedd y tywydd yn Aber ddoe?* - What was the weather like in Aber yesterday?\n\n----","urlName":"Places2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":42,"id":"e173534cdfe8d9545a9b91aeaa2b2898","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Opinions2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Opinions 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####I think that...\n\nWe look at the construction: **I think that...**  For example:\n\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **bod** Sioned yn hapus.* - I think **that** Sioned is happy.\n-  *Mae e'n meddwl **bod** Owen yn hoffi pannas.* - He thinks **that** Owen likes parsnips.\n-  *Dyn ni'n meddwl bod y ddrama'n wych.* - We think that the play is excellent.\n\nHere, *bod* is used to introduce our opinion, in the way that 'that' can be used in English, as in those examples.\n\n----\nWith a slightly modified pattern we can also use a pronoun at the start of what we think about someone.  For example:\n\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **ei fod e**'n hapus* - I think **that he** is happy.\n\nThe variant of ***bod*** used in this pattern varies according to the pronoun being used  - but only in the examples in bold type in the table below.  (The pronouns in brackets may be dropped):\n\n|      English    |       Welsh   |\n| -------------- | -------------- |\n|....that I am...    |...(fy) **mod** i'n...... |\n|....that you are...    |...(dy) **fod** ti'n...... |\n|....that he is...    |...(ei) **fod** e/o'n...... |\n|....that she is...    |...(ei) bod hi'n...... |\n|....that we are...    |...(ein) bod ni'n...... |\n|....that you are...    |...(eich) bod chi'n...... |\n|....that they...    |...(eu) bod nhw'n...... |\n\n\nSome more examples:\n\n-  *Mae Siôn yn meddwl **bod Sioned** yn hapus.* - Siôn thinks that Sioned is happy.\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **bod y pannas** yn ddrud.* - I think that the parsnips are expensive.\n-  *Dych chi'n meddwl **ei fod e**'n olygus?* - Do you think that he's handsome?\n-  *Rwyt ti'n meddwl **fy mod i**'n gyrru'n gyflym.* - You think that I am driving fast.\n-  *Mae nhw'n dweud **dy fod ti**'n fedrus.* - They say that you are skillful.\n-  *Dw i'n credu **eu bod nhw**'n byw ym Mangor erbyn hyn.* - I believe that they are living in Bangor now.\n\n----\n####More words that use this pattern\n\nSo far we have seen this pattern with *meddwl*, and then with *dweud* and *credu*.  It is in fact used quite widely, including with the following:\n\n-  *gobeithio ...* - hopefully ...\n-  *efallai/falle/ella ...* - perhaps ...\n-  *siŵr/sicr ...* - sure ...\n-  *er ...* - although ...\n-  *wrth gwrs ...* - of course ...\n\n-  *Gobeithio fy mod i wedi llwyddo.* - Hopefully I have succeeded.\n-  *Mae Siôn yn gobeithio bod Sioned yn gweithio'n galed heddiw.* - Siôn is hoping that Sioned works hard today.\n-  *Maen nhw'n siŵr ei fod e'n onest.* - They are sure that he is honest.\n-  *Efallai ei bod hi'n bwrw glaw yn Llundain ar hyn o bryd.* - Perhaps it is raining in London at the moment.\n-  *Er ei bod hi'n bwrw glaw, dw i'n mynd allan eto.* - Although it's raining, I'm going out again.\n-  *Wrth gwrs fy mod i'n mynd i bysgota eto, pam lai?* - Of course I'm going fishing again, why not?\n\n-----\n####The pattern is the same in the imperfect\n\nEven if the hoping, thinking, saying and so on was happening in the past, the pattern with *bod* stays the same:\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n meddwl ei fod e'n onest.* - I thought that he was honest.\n-  *Roedd e'n gobeithio ei bod hi'n gweithio'n galed.* - He used to hope that she was working hard.\n-  *Ro'n nhw'n sicr ei fod e'n onest* - They were sure that he was honest.\n- *Roedd Sioned yn gobeithio ei fod e ar ei ffordd.* - Sioned was hoping that he was on his way.\n\n**Note** that we use the imperfect rather than the simple past for past feelings, thoughts, etc, as they are generally continual in nature:\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n meddwl ei fod e'n hyfryd.* - I thought that he was lovely.\n-  *Roedd hi'n gobeithio bod y trên ar amser.* - She hoped that the train was on time.\n\n----\n####The pattern can be used with *wedi* instead of *'n/yn*\n\nBy using *wedi* instead of *'n/yn* we can put the second clause into the present perfect or pluperfect tenses:\n\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **ei bod hi wedi mynd** adre.* - I think **that she has gone** home.

The word for 'fault, blame' is *bai*, and the English can be phrased in several ways:\n\n-  *Ar Siôn mae'r bai.* - 'Siôn is at fault', or 'It is Siôn's fault' or, 'The blame lies with Siôn', etc\n\n**Remember** that the preposition *ar*, like *i*, changes when used with pronouns:\n\n-  *Arna i mae'r bai.* - It's my fault.\n-  *Arnoch chi mae'r bai.* - You are to blame.\n-  *Ar y cwmni bws mae'r bai.* - The fault lies with the bus company.\n-  *Arnon ni i gyd mae'r bai.* - We are all to blame.\n\nFor questions and negatives:\n\n-  *Ar bwy mae'r bai?; Pwy sy ar fai?* - Who is to blame?\n-  *Dim arna i mae'r bai!* - It's not my fault!\n-  *Nage, dim ar Dewi mae'r bai; Nage, dim Dewi sy ar fai.* - No, it's not Dewi's fault.\n\n----\n####Answering Yes and No to an emphatic question.\n\n**Remember** that the simplest Yes/No in Welsh - *Ie/Nage* (or *Ia/Naci* in northern dialects) - is used in response to an emphatic question - a question that does not start with a verb:\n\n-  *Meddyg yw e?  Ie.* - Is he a doctor?  Yes.\n-  *I Aber dach chi'n mynd?  Naci, i'r Bala.* - Are you going to Aber?  No, to Bala. \n-  *Siôn ydy hwnna?  Nage, Dewi ydy o.* - Is that Siôn?  No, he's Dewi.\n-  Nage, dim ar y cwmni mae'r bai.* - No, it's not the company's fault.\n\n----","urlName":"Problems"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":17,"id":"40bd8ba1a378ca19ad4ad24e521729e4","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Prefer","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Prefer","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####How to express a preference\n'I prefer...' in Welsh is ***Mae'n well gyda fi...*** or ***Mae'n well gen i...***:\n\n-  *Mae'n well gyda fi seidr na **ch**wrw.*  -  I prefer cider to beer.\n-  *Mae'n well gen i seidr na **ch**wrw.*   -  I prefer cider to beer.\n-  *Mae'n well gyda fi **b**ysgod na **ch**ig.*  -  I prefer fish to meat.\n-  *Mae'n well gen i **b**ys na **ch**ennin.*   -  I prefer peas to leeks.\n\n**Note** that there is a soft mutation after *well gyda fi/gen i*, and an aspirate mutation after *na*.  \n\nA summary table of initial mutations in Welsh is here - https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Welsh/Mutations.\n\n----\nThere are two common ways of talking about things you **hate**:\n\n-  The simplest way is to use the verb-noun ***casáu*** (hating, to hate):\n\n-  *Dw i'n casáu nadroedd* - I hate snakes.\n-  *Mae hi'n casáu lladron* - She hates thieves.\n\n-  The other way is to the use the same sort of construction as in 'I prefer...':\n\n-  *Mae'n **gas** gyda fi nadroedd.*, or \n-  *Mae'n **gas** gen i nadroedd.*\n-  *Mae'n **gas** gynni hi **l**adron.*\n-  *Mae'n **gas** gyda fe **b**igoglys.*  (*pigoglys* - spinach)\n\n----\n####How to say 'I had better...'\nA very similar construction is used to say that someone **had better do** something - be careful to note the difference:\n\n-  *Mae'n well **gyda fi** fwydo'r ci na'r gath* - I prefer to feed the dog than the cat.\n-  *Mae'n well **i fi** fwydo'r ci* - I had better feed the dog\n\nSome more examples:\n\n-  *Mae'n well iddyn nhw fynd adre erbyn hanner nos.* - They had better go by midnight.\n-  *Mae'n well i Siân fwydo'r cathod cyn mynd allan.* - Siân had better feed the cats before going out.\n-  *Mae'n well gyda Dewi fynd allan, ond mae'n well iddo fe orffen paentio'r lolfa heno.* - Dewi prefers going out, but he had better finish painting the lounge this evening.\n\n----\n####Favourite things\n\nThe word for 'favourite' is *hoff* and, unusually in Welsh, this adjective comes before the noun (like *hen*, 'old').  Putting an adjective in front of a noun causes a soft mutation of the noun.\n\nWhen talking about a favourite thing it is usual to use the emphatic pattern, putting either the 'favourite thing' phrase or the 'thing' that is favourite first in the sentence:\n\n-  *Hufen iâ yw fy hoff **f**wyd.* - **Ice-cream** is my favourite food.  (*bwyd* - a food)\n-  *Fy hoff **b**eth yw hufen iâ.* - My **favourite** thing is ice-cream.\n-  *Cerdded oedd ein hoff **w**eithgaredd.* - **Walking** was our favourite pastime.  (*gweithgaredd* - a pastime)\n-  *Yr hen felin oedd eu hoff **l**e.* - **The old mill** was their favourite place.  (*melin* - a mill; *lle* - a place)\n-  *Eu hoff **b**wnc nhw yn y brifysgol oedd archeoleg.* - Their **favourite** subject at university was archaeology.\n\n----\n####A pet hate\n\nMy 'pet hate' (in US English, 'pet peeve') is 'the thing that I hate the most'.  In Welsh, this is expressed by using the phrase *cas beth*.  *cas* is an adjective, and when used in front of the noun, as in this particular phrase it causes a soft mutation of the noun that follows it, *peth*.  \n\nWhen talking about a 'pet hate' it is usual to put that phrase at the start of the sentence:\n\n-  *Fy nghas beth ydy llygod mawr.* - My pet hate is rats; The thing that I hate the most is rats.\n-  *Ei chas beth yw codi'n gynnar yn y bore.* - Her pet hate is getting up early in the morning;  The thing she hates the most is getting up early in the morning.\n\n----\n\n####Asking for 'some'\n\n'Some' in this context may mean 'a small amount of' an uncountable material or 'a small number' of countable things.  There are several ways of expressing these, but a couple of common ones are to use *peth* (for 'amount') and *rhai* (for countable items).  Remember that the object of a short-form verb takes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Mae dy hufen iâ'n edrych yn dda.  Ga i **b**eth?* - Your ice-cream looks good, may I have some/a little?\n-  *Mae'r afalau hynny'n edrych yn flasus.  Ga i **r**ai?* - Those apples look tasty.

Instead, in the colloquial register of the language, we use a workaround using *cael* (getting, to get):\n\n-  *Cafodd y car ei ddwyn.* (literally, 'The car had its stealing') -  The car was stolen.\n-  *Mi gaeth y dyn ei arestio.*  ('The man had his arresting') -  The man was arrested.\n-  *Pryd caeth y dyn ei arestio?* - When was the man arrested?\n-  *Bydd y car yn cael ei drwsio.* - The car will be repaired. (*trwsio* - repairing)\n-  *Mae'r dyn yn cael ei arestio.* - The man is being arrested.\n-  *Cafodd lladron eu harestio.* - Some thieves were caught.\n\nRemember that some of the possessive pronouns *(ei* (her)*, ein, eu)* cause the addition of *h-* at the front of a word beginning with a vowel.  **Note** that the 'echoing' pronoun sometimes used in the possessive pattern *(...ei char **hi**)* is not used in this pattern:\n\n-  *Cafodd Siân **ei h**anafu yn y ddamwain.* - Siân was injured in the accident.\n-  *Mi gaethon ni **ein h**enwebu gan ein rhieni.* - we were nominated by our parents.\n-  *Cân nhw **eu h**oedi.* - they will be delayed.\n\nSo, if you know how to use *cael*, you can use it to create passive sentences.\n\n----\nIf we want to say that something was done to someone **by** someone else, we use the preposition ***gan***, here meaning 'by'.  *Gan* causes soft mutation:\n\n-  *Cafodd lladron eu hela **gan yr heddwas**.* -  Some thieves were chased **by the policeman**. (*hela* - chasing, hunting)\n- *Mi gaeth y gemau eu dwyn **gan leidr**.* -  The gems were stolen by a burglar. (*lleidr* - burglar, thief)\n-  *Ces i fy nharo **gan gar**.* - I was hit by a car.  (*taro* - hitting, to hit)\n\n----\nThere is another workaround that you may hear of for making a passive  - that uses the 'impersonal' forms of verbs, but that is usually only used in more formal registers of Welsh, and we do not cover it in this course.\n\n----\n####Translating standalone verb-nouns - a reminder\n**Remember** that if you are asked to translate a verb-noun such as *bwyta, hoffi, yfed* on its own, not as part of a longer phrase, back into English on this course you should use the forms 'xxxing' or 'to xxx'. Do not answer with just 'xxx' (eat, like, drink, swim, etc) as those forms can often be mixed up with nouns (a swim, a drink, ...) or commands (eat!, drink!). When you look them up in a dictionary the distinction is made clear, but we cannot do that on this course.)\n\n----","urlName":"TheNews"}],[{"accessible":true,"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":2,"id":"cd698e7d2f6f0789a0c0b47c817ab0da","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"BroughtUp","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Brought Up","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit shows how to use the passive in the past.\n\n----\n####A passive in the simple past tense\n\nTo say **I was born** in Welsh, we use a roundabout construction - **I had my birthing**:\n\n-  *Ces i...* - I had...\n-  *...fy ngeni* - ...my birthing\n\nSo:\n\n-  *Ces i fy ngeni* - I was born\n\nWe use the same construction for being brought up *(magu)*:\n\n-  *Ces i fy magu* - I was brought up\n-  *Mi ges i fy magu* - I was brought up\n\nFor all other persons the construction is the same:\n\n-  *Mi gest/Cest ti dy eni a dy fagu yng Nghymru.* - you were born and brought up in Wales.\n-  *Mi gaeth/Cafodd Dewi ei eni yn Abertawe.* - Dewi was born in Swansea.\n-  *Mi gaethon/Cawson ni ein magu yn Aber.* - We were brought up in Aber.\n-  *Mi gaethoch/Cawsoch chi eich geni yn Abertawe.* - You were born in Swansea.\n\nThis construction is also useful for events such as being paid, being seen, getting arrested, and so on....:\n\n-  *Mi ges/Ces i fy nhalu ddoe* - I was paid yesterday *(talu)*\n-  *Mi gaeth/Cafodd Siân ei gweld gyda Dewi yn Aber ddydd Llun.* -  Siân was seen with Dewi in Aber on Monday.\n-  *Mi gaeth/Cafodd y lladron eu harestio yn y Rhyl wythnos diwethaf* - The thieves were arrested in Rhyl last week.\n\n----\nRemember the different mutations after the various possessive pronouns:\n\n-  *fy* + nasal \n-  *dy* + soft\n-  *ei* (his) + soft\n-  *ei* (her) + aspirate/*h-*vowel\n-  *ein* + *h-*vowel\n-  *eich* + no mutation\n-  *eu* = + *h-*vowel\n\nThe *h-*vowel occurs when an *h-* is added in front of a vowel:\n\n-  *Mi gaeth hi ei hachub* - She was rescued *(achub)*\n-  *Cawson ni ein henwi*  -  We were named *(enwi)* \n-  *Mi gaethon nhw eu hufuddhau* - They were obeyed *(ufuddhau)* \n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Mi ges i fy ngeni ym Mhorthmadog-* - I was born in Porthmadog-\n-  *Mi gest ti dy dalu ddoe.* - You got paid yesterday.\n-  *Cafodd Siân ei phenodi i swydd dda iawn.* - Siân got appointed to a very good job.\n-  *Mi gaeth Ffred ei alw gan ei fòs.* - Ffred was called by his boss.\n-  *Cafodd y plant eu haddysgu ym Mangor.* - The children were educated in Bangor.\n-  *Cawson ni ein gwahodd i'r parti.* - We were invited to the party.\n\n----\nIf we want to say that we were seen/paid/brought up/ arrested, etc **by** someone, we use the word ***gan*** (+ soft mutation):\n\n-  *Cafodd y lladron eu harestio **gan** yr heddlu.* - The thieves were arrested **by** the police.\n-  *Mi gaeth Siân ei magu **gan f**am ei thad.* - Sîân was brought up **by** her father's mother.\n-  *Mi gaeth ein bil ei dalu **gan G**wmni Mawr ddoe.* - Our bill was paid by Cwmni Mawr yesterday.\n\n----","urlName":"BroughtUp"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":24,"id":"83d3223734b4653203335f75d424b758","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Favours","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Favours","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\nThis unit teaches the conjugated forms in the future tense of the verb **gwneud** ('doing, to do, making, to make'), which can be used to say, for example:\n\n-  *Gwna i gacen.* - I will make a cake.\n-  *Gwnewch chi'r cinio heno.* - You will make the dinner this evening.\n\n----\n####Future of *gwneud* (doing, making)\n\n| English | Statement | Question | Negative |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I will do | *Gwna i* | *Wna i?* | *Wna i ddim* |\n| You will do (informal singular) | *Gwnei di* | *Wnei di?* | *Wnei di ddim* |\n| He will do | *Gwnaiff e* (SW) / *Gwneith o* (NW) | *Wnaiff e?* (SW) / *Wneith o?* (NW)  | *Wnaiff e ddim* (SW) / *Wneith o  ddim* (NW) |\n| She will do | *Gwnaiff hi* (SW) / *Gwneith hi* (NW) | Wnaiff hi?

For example, early in the course we met:\n\n-  *Megan ydw i* - I am Megan\n-  *Athrawes yw Megan* - Megan is a teacher\n\nNow, instead of emphasising Megan's name or occupation we can emphasise that, for example, **Megan** who is in a particular place:\n\n-  *Megan sy yma* - 'It is **Megan** who is here', or '**Megan** is here'\n-  *Dewi sy yma, hefyd* - **Dewi** is here, too.\n-  *Fi sy'n prynu'r car 'na heddiw* - It's me who's buying that car today\n\n**Note** that this requires a different form of the verb - instead of *mae* or *ydy/yw* - ***sy***  (you may also see the full form of *sy* - *sydd*).  \n\n**Note** that *sy* is only used for this purpose in the present tense.  In the future tense we use *fydd*, and in the imperfect we use *oedd*.\n\n**Note** that nowadays the English pattern 'It is I who is...', It is she who is...' is rarely used in English except in very formal situations, so despite it's being grammatically correct, it is not used on this course.  We use the less formal 'It is me/us/her who...', which is a better match for the informal register of Welsh taught on this course.\n\n----\n####Emphasising who it is who owns something\n\nSo far we have met:\n\n-  *Mae pensil gyda fi.* - I have a pencil.\n-  *Oes pensil gyda ti?* - Do you have a pencil?\n\nNow I pick up a pencil that I think is yours, not mine, not Dewi's. I want to ask 'Do **you** own this pencil?'  There is a very irregular verb that we use for this: - ***biau*** (sometimes seen as *piau*).  *biau* is only used with an emphatic pattern.  \n\nIn the colloquial language this pattern is:\n\n-  *Chi biau hwn?* - Do **you** own this? Is it **you** who owns this?\n-  *Dewi biau'r pensil 'ma?* - Does **Dewi** own this?; Is it **Dewi** who owns this?\n\nTo state who owns it, we just drop the question mark and we do not lift our voice towards the end of the question:\n\n-  *Dewi biau'r pensil 'na.* - It's Dewi who owns that.  **Dewi** owns that pencil.\n\n**Note** that you will also come across the pattern with *sy* being used - that is perfectly valid in colloquial Welsh, too, although the *sy* is unnecessary.  Where *sy* is used, there is no *'n/yn* following *sy* - *biau* is a verb in its own right, not a verb-noun. \n\nIn other tenses another verb is needed, as *biau* is a defective verb with no other forms in modern Welsh:\n\n-  *Sioned **oedd** biau'r tŷ.* - It was Sioned who **used to** own the house..  Sioned **used to** own the house.\n-  *Pwy **fydd** biau'r tafarn ar ôl Sam?* - Who is it who **will** own the pub after Sam? Who **will** own the pub after Sam?\n\n----","urlName":"Emphasise1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":32,"id":"17811cd3bd3db13799a67d407ac36cd1","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Extend2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Extend 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Is it a verb or is it a noun?\n\nWhen we mention verbs-nouns such as *bwyta, cerdded, mynd* and so on it is normal to think of them as meaning 'to eat, 'to walk', to go' - this is what we are used to in English.\n\nIn Welsh, things are a little different.  The verb-nouns in this basic form are actually closer in meaning to the English -ing participles 'eating', 'walking', 'singing', and they can also be used as nouns:\n\n-  *Dw i'n mynd i wrando ar **y canu*** - I am going to listen to **the singing/playing**\n\nThese verb-nouns are very flexible:\n\n-  *Dw i'n hoffi gwylio**'r rasio** ar y teledu* - I like watching **the racing** on the TV\n-  *Dyn ni'n hoffi **bwyta allan*** - We like **eating out**\n-  Roedd **y canu** yn y cyngerdd neithiwr yn wych - **the singing** at the concert last night was excellent\n\n----\n####'He **had** done something' - the pluperfect tense\n\nEarlier in the course we covered how to use *wedi* to say that someone **has** done something:\n\n-  *Mae e **wedi darllen** y llyfr.* - He **has read** the book.\n\nWe also covered the imperfect tense:\n\n-  *Roedd e'n darllen bob dydd.* - He **used to read** every day.\n-  *Roedd hi'n bwrw glaw.* - It **was** raining.\n\nThese can be combined to make the pluperfect tense - 'had done' something.  We use *wedi* with *roedd, etc*:\n\n-  *Roedd e wedi darllen y llyfr yn barod.* - He **had read** the book already.\n-  *Roedd hi wedi mynd i'r sinema cyn mynd i'r bwyty.* - She **had gone** to the cinema before going to the restaurant.\n-  *Roedd hi wedi bwrw glaw yn y nos.* - It had rained in the night.\n-  *Ro'n i wedi gwneud y golchi'n barod.* - I had done the washing already.\n\n----\n####Aspirate mutation\n\nThe aspirate mutation affects only the initial letters *p-, t-, c-*:\n\n-  *p- -> ph-*\n-  *t- -> th-*\n-  *c- -> ch-*\n\nThere are several causes of the aspirate mutation of *p, t, c*  in modern Welsh.  Here is a summary of the causes covered in this course:\n\n-  Negative short-form verbs (although this is not always observed, especially among younger people)\n-  After *ei...* when it means 'her...'\n-  After *â, gyda, tua*\n-  After *a* when it means 'and'\n-  After *na* when it means 'than'\n-  After the numbers *tri, chwe* (remember that *chwech* drops the final *-ch*)\n\n----\n####Years in dates\n\nFor years up to 1999, the numbers are usually just listed.  The initial '1---' can be said as either *un* or *mil*:\n\n-  *mil naw un un; un naw un un* - nineteen eleven\n-  *mil naw naw naw; un naw naw naw* - nineteen ninety-nine\n\nFor 2000 to 2010 it is usually '*dwy fil a/ac* number':\n\n-  *dwy fil ac un* - two thousand and one, 2001\n-  *dwy fil a **ph**edwar* - two thousand and four, 2004\n-  *dwy fil a deg* - two thousand and ten, 2010\n\nFor 2011 and later it is usually '*dwy fil* number':\n\n-  *dwy fil un deg pump* - two thousand and fifteen, 2015\n-  *dwy fil dau ddeg dau* - two thousand and twenty-two, 2022\n\nIn saying 'in' a year, use *yn* followed by a nasal mutation:\n\n-  *yn un naw chwech chwech; y**m m**il naw chwech chwech* - in 1966\n-  *yn **n**wy fil dau ddeg dau* - in 2022\n\n----","urlName":"Extend2"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":32,"id":"2afa4a7817a83e4c8bd2d030a23c640e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Future Gwneud 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"F Gwneud 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Future with *Gwneud*\n\nThis unit supports Cwrs Sylfaen 18\n\n----\n####The short-form future tense of *gwneud*\n\nWe have already met the future using forms of the verb 'bod':  \n\n-  *Bydda i'n gwneud bwrdd yfory.* - I will be making a table tomorrow.\n-  *Byddi di'n gwneud y swper heno* - You will be making supper this evening.\n\nInstead of using the future of *bod* to make the future tense, we can also use a 'short-form' future of *gwneud* and other verbs without using *bod*.  This is especially common with *gwneud, mynd, dod* and *cael*.\n\nThe 'short-form' future implying a single future action is formed using the stem of the verb, in the same way as the past tense, and adding the appropriate future tense endings.\n\nThe future tenses of *mynd, dod, cael* and *gwneud* all look quite similar. but with a few differences.

The second is common in parts of mid- and north Wales.\n-  Remember that, as with *Ga i...?* and the short-form past tense, the object of short-form verb takes a soft mutation.\n-  The positive short-forms of *cael* and *gwneud* often take a soft mutation in the colloquial language.\n\nExamples:\n\n-  *Gwna i **g**inio i ni heno.* - I will make dinner for us  this evening. *(cinio)*\n-  *Gwnei di **d**egan yfory* - You will make a toy tomorrow. *(tegan)*\n-  *Gwnaiff hi **l**anast yn y lolfa* - SHe wil make a mess in the lounge.\n-  *Gwnewch chi **f**wrdd wythnos nesa.* - You will make a table next week. *(bwrdd)*\n\n----\nThe positive statement marker *mi/fe* is sometimes added at the start of the sentence in some dialects.

All we need to do is to remember what the stem is, and then we add the verb-ending for the future tense.  You have met the idea of verb stems earlier in the course in the section on the short-form past tense.\n\nHere is the full pattern using *canu* ('singing') as the example:\n\n-  *Can**a** i* - I will sing\n-  *Can**i** di* - you will sing\n-  *Can**iff**/Can**ith** e/hi/y plant* - he/she/the children will sing\n-  *Can**wn** ni* - we will sing\n-  *Can**wch** chi* - you will sing\n-  *Can**an** nhw* - they will sing\n\n**Note** that the *-ith* ending in the third person future is more often used in some of the north and mid-Wales dialects, but you will come across both in the media.\n\n**Remember** that short-form verbs cause a soft mutation of their object:\n\n-  *Canwch chi **g**ân.* - You will sing a song *(cân)*\n\nHere are some more examples:\n\n-  *Cyrhaedda i Aber erbyn hanner nos.* - I will reach Aber by midnight.\n-  *Taliff e'r bil.* - He will pay the bill.\n-  *Prynwn ni **g**ar newydd fis nesaf.* - We'll buy a new car next month.\n-  *Coginian nhw swper nes ymlaen.* - They'll cook supper later.\n-  *Gorffennwch chi **l**anhau'ch cegin yfory.* - You will finish cleaning your kitchen tomorrow.\n\nRemember that if you use the particle *mi* in front of a positive verb, it causes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Mi **g**yrhaedda i Aber erbyn hanner nos.*\n-  *Mi **d**alith o'r bil.*\n-  *Mi **b**rynwn ni gar newydd.*\n\n----\n####Questions and answers\n\nQuestions take a soft mutation as usual:\n\n-  *Gyrhaedda i Aber erbyn hanner nos?* - Will I reach Aber by midnight?\n-  *Daliff e'r bil ar amser?* - Will he pay the bill on time?\n-  *Brynwn ni **g**ar newydd wythnos nesa?* - Will we buy a new car next week?\n-  *Orffennwch chi **l**anhau'r garej yfory?* - Will you finish cleaning the garage tomorrow?\n\nFor yes/no answers we use the yes/no forms from the future of *gwneud*:\n\n-  *Daliff hi'r bil ar amser?

This method is widely used all over Wales, especially in conversation.\n\n**Remember** that the object of a short-form verb takes a soft mutation.  In this case, the object of *gwneud* is the verb-noun for which we are creating the simple future tense.  Using the example of *canu*:\n\n-  *Gwna i **g**anu.* - I will sing.\n-  *Gwnei di ganu.* - You will sing.\n-  *Gwnaiff/Gwneith e/hi/Siân/y plant ganu.* - He/she/Siân/the children will sing.\n-  *Gwnawn ni ganu.* - We will sing.\n-  *Gwnewch chi ganu.* - You will sing.\n-  *Gwnân nhw ganu.* - They will sing.\n\nThe initial *g-* is often dropped in speech and the remaining *w-* may only be lightly pronounced, if at all.\n\nIn parts of north and mid-Wales, the particle *mi* is often added at the start of the phrase. In some parts of Wales you may also hear *fe* being used in the same way. *Mi/Fe* causes a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Mi wna i ganu.* - I will sing.\n-  *Mi wnaiff/wneith o ganu.* - He will sing.\n-  *Mi wnaiff/wneith Siân ganu.* - Siân will sing.\n-  *Fe wnân nhw ganu.* - They will sing.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Gwna i siarad â Sian.* - I will speak to Siân.\n-  *Mi wna i gerdded efo Siôn.* - I will walk with Siôn.\n-  *Gwnewch chi ddarllen llyfrau yfory.* - You will read some books tomorrow.\n-  *Gwnei di ddarllen y llyfrau yfory.* - You will read the books tomorrow.\n\n----\n####Questions and answers\n\nAs with the future of *gwneud* earlier in the course, just use the soft mutated form of *gwna i, etc* and raise the tone at the end of the question:\n\n-  *Wna i siarad â Sian?* - Will I speak to Siân?\n-  *Wna i gerdded gyda/efo Siôn?* - Will I walk with Siôn?\n-  *Wnaiff o weld cathod yno?* - Will he see any cats there? \n-  *Wnewch chi ddarllen llyfrau yfory* - Will you read any books tomorrow?\n\n**Remember** that *Fe/Mi* is never used with a question.\n\n----\nThe answers to any question in the simple future are the use that person's form of the future of *gwneud*\n\n-  *Wnewch chi ddarllen y nofel 'na?  Gwna/Gwnawn.* - Will you read that novel?  Yes. (I/we).\n-  *Wnân nhw nofio yn y môr yfory?  Na wnân, bydd y dŵr yn rhy oer.* - WIll they swim in the sea tomorrow?  No, the water will be too cold.\n\n----\n####Negatives\nAs with other negatives, the verb takes a mixed mutation (soft mutation in the case of *gwneud*) and add *ddim*.  The *ddim* has a soft mutation as the start of the object of the *gwneud* verb, so we do not mutate the verb-noun which follows it:\n\n-  *Wna i ddim siarad â Sian* - I won't speak to Siân\n-  *Wna i ddim cerdded gyda/efo Siôn* - I will not walk with Siôn. (no mutation of *cerdded*)\n-  *Wnewch chi ddim darllen llyfrau yfory* - You will not read any books tomorrow. (no mutation of *darllen*)\n-  *Wnân nhw ddim cyrraedd y neuadd mewn pryd* - They will not arrive at the hall in time.\n\n----","urlName":"Aux-Fut-Gwneud"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":14,"id":"e5b10070ca6da2c43fbe5d242a5bcecc","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Revision4","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Revision 4","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####British English expressions\n\nIn British English, we 'take' or 'sit' an academic, etc, examination.

Basai, yn bendant* - Would Eleri be happy living in the capital city?  Yes, definitely.\n\n----\n####I would prefer...\n\nWe can use the conditional to express a preference, too.

It only exists in a conditional form:\n\n-  *Dylwn i* - I should\n-  *Dylet ti* - you should\n-  *Dylai fe/fo/hi/'r plant* - he/she/the children should\n-  *Dylen ni* - we should\n-  *Dylech chi* - you should\n-  *Dylen nhw* - they should\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Dylen ni weithio'n galed.* - We should work hard.\n-  *Ddylai'r plant ddim chwarae yno* - The children shouldn't play there.\n-  *Ddylen nhw dalu'r bil 'na?* - Should they pay that bill?\n\n----\n***Gallu*** (being able to) (or *Medru*) can also be used with a conditional form, meaning 'could (be able to)' using the same endings:\n\n-  *Gallwn/Medrwn i ddarllen y nofel 'na heddiw* - I could read that novel today\n-  *Gallet ti beintio'r gegin yfory* - you could paint the kitchen tomorrow\n-  *Allai'r mecanic edrych ar fy nghar?* - could the mechanic look at my car?\n-  *Allen ni ddim dod i'r cyfarfod cyn wyth o'r gloch* - We couldn't come to the meeting before eight o'clock\n-  *Allech chi alw nes ymlaen?* - could you call later?\n-  *Gallen/Medren nhw helpu symud y cwpwrdd trwm 'na* - they could help to move that heavy cupboard\n\n----\n####Unlikely if\nIf something unlikely were to happen - in English we often combine two conditionals to say what we **would** do if something unlikely **were to** happen:\n\n-  **If I were** to win the lottery, **I would** buy a lovely house.\n\nIn Welsh, there is a special form of *bod* which includes the 'unlikely if'.  It uses the same conditional endings shown above.  Instead of the word begining with *bas-/bydd-*, it starts with *tas-*:\n\n-  *Taswn i'n ennill y loteri, baswn i'n prynu tŷ hyfryd* - If **I were** to win the lottery, I would buy a lovely house.\n-  *Tasai hi'n colli ei swydd, basai hi'n drist* - **if she were** to lose her job, she would be sad.\n\nHere is the full conjugation:\n\n-  *taswn i* - if I were to be\n-  *taset ti* - if you were to be\n-  *tasai fe/fo/hi/'r plant* - if he/she/the children were to be\n-  *tasen ni* - if we were to be\n-  *tasech chi* - if you were to be\n-  *tasen nhw* - if they were to be\n\n**Note** that *tas-* forms are usually matched with *bas-* forms rather than *bydd-* forms.\n\n**Note** that we do not use *os* for 'if' in this case.  We use *os* if the likelihood of the thing happening is neutral.  We do not normally use a conditional tense with *os*:\n\n-  *Os bydd hi'n bwrw glaw, bydda i'n gwisgo fy nhgôt* - if it rains, I'll wear my coat\n-  *Os ydy Dewi'n dod â Sioned ymlaen nawr, bydd Siân yn ymadael* - If Dewi is bringing Sioned along now, Siân will leave\n\n(Usually *os* is used with a future tense, but if we do use it with the third person present tense, as in the second example, it must be *os ydy...*, not * *os mae...*, although that is a common mistake.)\n\n-----\n####Not minding\nWhen we are asked whether we would like to do something,  we may want to answer:  'I don't mind', 'it doesn't matter'  In Welsh we use expressions including the word *ots*:\n\n-  *Fasai'n well gyda ti sglodion neu stwnsh?  Does dim ots gyda fi.* -  Would you prefer chips or mashed potato?  I don't mind.\n\nThere are several variations in common use in the colloquial spoken language:\n\n-  *Does dim ots gen i/gyda fi.* - I don't mind.\n-  *Sdim ots 'da fe.* - He doesn't mind.\n-  *Dim ots; Sdim ots.* - No matter; It doesn't matter.\n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Fasai'n well gyda fe fynd nawr neu nes ymlaen?  Sdim ots ganddo fe.* - Would he prefer to go now or later?  He doesn't mind\n-  *Ydy hi am weithio yn y dref neu yn y gwlad?  Does dim ots ganddi hi* - Does she want to work in town or in the country-side?  She doesn't care.\n-  *Does dim cwrw ar ôl!  Dim ots, mae 'na ddigon o ddŵr.*  - There's no beer left!  No matter, there's plenty of water.\n\n----","urlName":"WouldDo"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":16,"id":"21b777a219e863caf37fdf034d433565","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"GiveAdvice","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Advice","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Ought to, Should do\n\nThere is a verb **Dylwn** - 'ought to, should' - that we use when saying that someone 'should' or 'ought to' do something.  Only the conditional tense is in use in  colloquial Modern Welsh.\n\n(Because its other forms, such as its verb-noun and its other tenses, are missing, it is called a 'defective' verb.)\n\nIt has the same conditional tense endings as *baswn i* ( I would be),  *hoffwn i'* ( I would like), etc, that are introduced elsewhere in the course:\n\n-  *Dyl**wn** i* - I should, I ought to\n-  *Dyl**et** ti*\n-  *Dyl**ai** fe/fo/hi/Dewi/y plant*\n-  *Dyl**en** ni*\n-  *Dyl**ech** chi*\n-  *Dyl**en** nhw*\n\nNote that *fe/fo* is usually used in preference to *e/o* with verbs ending in *-ai*.\n\nIt is followed by a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Dylwn i fynd* - I should go\n-  *Dylen nhw goginio* - They should cook\n-  *Ddylwn i ddim mynd* - I should not go (*dim* has caught the mutation here, not *mynd*)\n\n----\n####Ought to have, Should have\nTo form a past tense, we add *bod wedi* in front of the verb-noun, and it is *bod wedi* which catches the mutation:\n\n-  *Dylwn i **fod wedi** mynd* - I should **have** gone\n\nWith the negative, as before, it is *dim* which catches the mutation:\n\n-  *Ddylen nhw **dd**im bod wedi mynd* - They should not have gone.\n-  *Ddylet ti **dd**im bod wedi gwneud cinio heddiw* - You should not have made lunch today\n\n----\n###Idiomatic expressions\n\nIdiomatic expressions are those which convey a meaning, but by using words or structures that do not necessarily say so directly.  In English, for example:\n\n-  'I'm not as green as I am cabbage-looking', which is a very odd thing to say!  The meaning is along the lines of 'Just because I look dull and uninteresting doesn't mean that I don't have some experience or ideas to contribute'.\n\nIn this unit we introduce a Welsh idiom that might be said when giving advice:\n\n-  *Araf deg mae dal iâr* - literally 'Slow and steady catches a hen'.  A similar English idiom might be 'Softly, softly catchee monkey', meaning that success in a task sometimes comes from working steadily and quietly, rather than by rushing into it headlong.\n\nAs in English, many idioms and sayings in Welsh use quite old-fashioned or very formal words and patterns, as in this piece of advice which applies well to learning Welsh:\n\n-  *Dyfal donc a dyrr y garreg* - 'Steady tapping breaks the stone', or 'You will succeed if you keep at it regularly and a little at a time'.\n\n----\nAs a reminder, there is an idiomatic way of saying that somebody wants to do something.  This uses the preposition *am*.  Remember that *am* causes soft mutation:\n\n-  *Mae Siôn **am fynd** yn gynnar* - Siôn **wants to go** early\n-  *Roedd Eleri a Dewi **am aros** tan hanner nos* - Eleri and Dei **wanted to stay** until midnight\n-  *Dw i am wella fy Nghymraeg* - I want to improve my Welsh  (*gwella* - improving, to improve)\n\n----","urlName":"GiveAdvice"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":32,"id":"0b8c805ba1a893feebc01eb4af80ac4e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Distance&Size","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Size","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Audio\n**Please remember** that there are occasional known glitches in the computer-generated voice - unfortunately the course team can do nothing about this, so please do not report audio faults.

Singular feminine nouns, such as **milltir** (*a mile*), take a soft mutation after *un, dwy*.  \n\nRemember that *pum(p), chwe(ch), can(t)* lose their final letter *(p, ch, t)* before nouns, masculine or feminine.  (**Note** that until Duo fix the system-wide zombie sentence bug we are unable to remove examples where this has not been done here.)\n\nLook at the the following examples, and note the changes in form of 2, 3, 4 and the soft mutation after *un, dwy*:\n\n-  Un **f**illtir\n-  Dwy **f**illtir\n-  Tair **m**illtir\n-  Pedair **m**illtir\n-  Pum **m**illtir\n-  Chwe **m**illtir\n-  Saith, Wyth, Naw **m**illtir\n-  Deng/Deg **m**illtir (note the optional change from *-g* to *-ng* at the end of *deg* - this is getting less common nowadays, but it is still used by many people)\n\nNote that *un* causes a **weak soft mutation** - no mutation of feminine nouns beginning *ll-, rh-*:\n\n-  *un llaw* - one hand\n-  *un rhaglen deledu* - one television programme\n\nNote that the feminine form *tair* does not cause a mutation, whereas the masculine form *tri* causes an aspirate mutation:\n\n-  *tair cath - three cats (feminine noun *cath*)\n-  *tri chi* - three dogs (masculine noun *ci*)\n\nThis use of feminine number forms, the weak soft mutation after *un*, and the soft mutation after *dwy* apply to all singular feminine nouns. \n\n----\nRemember that masculine nouns take a soft mutation after *dau*, just as feminine nouns do after *dwy*. \n\n-  *dwy gath - two cats (feminine noun *cath*)\n-  *dau gi* - three dogs (masculine noun *ci*)\n\n----\n####How far?  How big?\n\nWhen asking 'how far?', 'how big?', 'how wide?', 'how tasty?' and so on, we use **pa mor...?**  Like *un* above, *mor* in this sense causes a weak soft mutation:\n\n-  *Pa mor **b**ell ydy Bangor?* - How far is Bangor?*(pell)*\n-  *Pa mor **fawr** ydy Bangor?* - How large is Bangor? *(mawr)*\n-  *Pa mor **f**lasus oedd y pysgod neithiwr?* - How tasty was the fish last night?  *(blasus)*\n-  *Pa mor **d**rwchus yw'r rhew yno?* - How thick is the ice there? *(trwchus)*\n-  *Pa mor **ll**ydan ydy'r bwrdd?* - How wide is the table?  (no mutation of *llydan*)\n\n----\nIn answer we might say:\n\n-  *Deg milltir i ffwrdd mae Bangor* - Bangor is ten miles away\n-  *Mae'r bwrdd 'ma tua phum troedfedd o led* - This table is about five feet wide\n-  *Mae'r rhew 'na dros filltir o drwch* - That ice is over a mile thick.\n\n**Note** that *troedfedd* means a foot in length, not a foot with toes!\n\n----\n####Quoting what someone said\n\nThere is a special verb to quote what someone said in the past, and we introduce some forms of it here.\n\n-  *meddai fe/fo/hi* - he/she said\n-  *medden nhw* - they said\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Mae'n ddeg milltir i Fangor, medden nhw* - It is ten miles to Bangor, they said.\n-  *Mae Pwllheli yn awr i ffwrdd, meddai Dewi* - Pwllheli is an hour away, said Dewi.\n\n----\n####British English usage\nIn British English, people's weights are expressed in kilograms, or in stones and pounds rather than in pounds alone.  In Welsh, a pound weight (lb) is *pwys* and a stone weight (st) is *stôn*.\n\nNote:- 1 stone (in weight) = 14 pounds (in weight)\n\n----","urlName":"DistanceSize"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":40,"id":"b55f975fb81c7ce73037ba402c350782","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Comparing1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Compare 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####The equative pattern for adjectives - 'as xxx as'\n\nThe usual pattern for saying that something is 'as xxx as' something else, the equative pattern, is by using **mor**:\n\n-  **mor** + **adjective** + **â** = 'as.......as':\n\n-  *mor hapus â* = as happy as\n-  *mor aml â*  =  as often as\n-  *mor enwog â*  =  as famous as\n\n**mor** causes weak soft mutation (no mutation of *ll-* or *rh-*):\n\n-  *mor **b**oblogaidd â*  =  as popular as *(p -> b)*\n-  *mor **g**och â*  =  as red as *(c -> g)*\n-  *mor **ll**wyd â*  =  as grey as  (no mutation)\n-  *mor **rh**ugl â*  =  as fluent as  (no mutation)\n\nRemember that *â*, like *gyda*, causes an aspirate mutation:\n\n-  *mor llawen â **ch**og* - as happy as a cuckoo *(cog)*\n-  *mor falch â **ph**aun*  =  as proud as a peacock *(paun)*\n-  *mor dal â **th**ŵr*  =  as tall as a tower *(tŵr)*\n\n** Note that *ti* (you) usually resists this aspirate mutation:\n\n-  *Mae e mor dal â ti* - He is as tall as you are\n\n**Note** that when **â** precedes a vowel, it changes to **ag**, just as *gyda* changes to *gydag*. For example:\n\n-  *mor hapus **ag** Elen*  =  as happy as Elen\n\n----\nA few adjectives are irregular in their equative form, and instead of using *mor*, the particle *cyn* is used with them, or embedded in them, instead.  (*cyn* sometimes loses its *-n* when it is embedded.)  \n\nHere are some common ones:\n\n-  *cymaint* - as large, as many  (preferred to *mor fawr*)\n-  *cynifer* - as many\n-  *cynddrwg* - as bad  (preferred to *mor ddrwg*)\n-  *cystal* - as good  (preferred to *mor dda*)\n-  *cyn lleied* - as small  (preferred to *mor fach*)\n\nLike *mor*, *cyn* causes weak soft mutation.  \n\n(**Note** - this usage of *cyn* is completely separate to its meaning of 'before'.)\n\n----\n**Note** that this pattern is also used to say that something is 'so big', 'so red', 'so fast' etc, often with a soft mutation if it acts as an adverb:\n\n-  *Mae'r ci 'na cymaint!* - That dog is so big!\n-  *Diolch am y blodau, rwyt ti cystal!* - Thanks for the flowers, you are so good!\n- *Llongyfarchiadau ar ennill, gwnest ti redeg **g**ystal!* - Congratulations on winning, you ran so well!\n\n----\nWhen used following a verb-form of *bod*, there is no need to put *yn/'n* between the verb and the adjective to link them - *mor/cyn* provides this link instead:\n\n-  *Dw i**'n** hen.* - I am old.\n-  *Dw i **mor** hen â Siân.* - I am as old as Siân.\n-  *Roedd Siôn **yn** ddrwg.* - Siôn was naughty.\n-  *Roedd Eleri **cyn**ddrwg â Siôn.* - Eleri was as naughty as Siôn.\n-  *Mae'r eliffant **yn** fawr.*  -  The elephant is big.\n-  *Dydy'r eliffant ddim **cy**maint â thŷ.* -  The elephant is not as big as a house.\n\n----\nWe may want to compare things to other things by saying that something is **like** something else.  For this we can use ***fel***:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n edrych **fel** angel.* - She looks **like** an angel.\n-  *Mae e'n edrych fel wyneb y Lleuad.* - It looks like the surface of the Moon.\n-  *Mae Dewi'n edrych yn union fel ei dad.* - Dewi looks just like his dad.\n\n----\n\n####'Together' and 'as each other'\n\nWhen discussing people 'together' with one another or 'as (something) as each other' we use the word *gilydd*.  (This is a mutated form of *cilydd*, as word which is now rarely seen).  *Gilydd* is most often used in conjunction with:\n\n-  *gyda* + a shortened possessive pronoun, to mean 'with each other' or with \n-  *â* + a shortened possessive pronoun, to mean 'as each other'\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Dyn ni'n bwyta gyda'n gilydd.* - We are eating together, We are eating with each other.\n-  *Dych chi'n cerdded gyda'ch gilydd.* - You are walking together, You are walking with each other.\n-  *Maen nhw'n mynd i Aber gyda'i gilydd.* - They are going to Aber together.\n\n**Note** the form *...**'i** gilydd* that is used with they/*nhw*.\n\n-  *Dyn ni mor hen â'n gilydd.* - We are as old as each other.\n-  *Dych chi mor gyflym â'ch gilydd* - You are as fast as each other.\n-  *Maen nhw cynddrwg â'i gilydd!* - They are as bad as each other!\n\n----","urlName":"Comparing1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":43,"id":"87956cfef890e2ae68c71e3d8986d546","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Would Hoffi Gallu","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Hoffi Gall","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Conditional forms of *Hoffi/Licio* (liking) and *Gallu/Medru* (being able to)\n\nIn an earlier section you met the use of the conditional of bod to form expresssions such as 'I would....'\n\n-  *Baswn i'n hoffi cath* - I would like a cat\n-  *Baset ti'n licio mynd* - You would like to go\n-  *Basai fo'n medru rhedeg* - He could run\n\nHowever, as with the future and past tenses, it is possible to express the conditional using short forms of verbs.  This is commonly used in colloquial Welsh with the verbs *hoffi/licio* (liking, to like) and *gallu/medru* (being able, to be able).\n\n----\nThe verb endings in the short-form conditional are the same as those of the conditional of *bod*, but this time added to the stems of *hoffi (hoff-), licio (lici-), gallu (gall-)* and *medru (medr-)* respectively.\n\nFor example, here is how the conditional tense of *hoffi* runs.  The other verbs take the same endings:\n\n|  Verb with **ending**  | Translation |\n| ---- | ---- |\n|  *hoff**wn** i*  |  I would like|\n|  *hoff**et** ti*  |  You would like (singular familar)|\n|  *hoff**ai** fe/fo*  |  He would like|\n|  *hoff**ai** hi*   |  She would like|\n|  *hoff**en** ni*  | We would like|\n|  *hoff**ech** chi*  |  You would like (polite or plural)|\n|  *hoff**en** nhw*   | They would like|\n\nAs with other short-form verbs, the short-form condtional of these verbs is followed by a soft mutation of the object:\n\n-  *Liciwn i **g**ath.* - I would like a cat.\n-  *Hoffet ti **f**ynd adre.* - You would like to go home.\n-  *Medrai fo **r**edeg i'r siop.* - He could run to the shop.\n-  *Gallai hi **l**ifio'r pren.* - She would be able to saw the wood.\n-  *Licien ni **g**ael cawl pannas i ginio.* - We would like to have some parsnip soup for lunch.\n-  *Hoffech chi **B**orthmadog.* - You would like Porthmadog.\n-  *Gallen nhw **g**oginio cinio Sul.* - They could cook Sunday dinner.\n\n----\n####Questions and Answers\n\nAs with other verbs, the question forms take a soft mutation where possible:\n\n-  *Liciet ti fynd adre?* - Would you like to go home?\n-  *Fedrai fe redeg i'r siop?* - Could he run to the shop?\n-  *Allai hi nofio yn y môr?* - Could she swim in the sea?\n-  *Hoffen nhw gwrdd â Sioned?* - Would they like to meet Sioned?\n\nFor answers, we use a suitable conditional form of the same verb, but without the pronoun.  In a negative answers, *na* causes a mixed mutation, although just a soft mutation is needed here, and only with *gallu* and *medru*:\n\n-  *Liciet ti fynd adre?  Liciwn* - Would you like to go home? Yes.\n-  *Liciet ti fynd adre?  Na liciwn* - Would you like to go home? No.\n-  *Fedrai fe redeg i'r siop? Medrai.* - Could he run to the shop? Yes.\n-  *Fedrai fe redeg i'r siop? Na fedrai.* - Could he run to the shop? No.\n-  *Allai hi nofio yn y môr? Gallai* - Could she swim in the sea?  Yes.\n-  *Allai hi nofio yn y môr? Na allai* - Could she swim in the sea?  No.\n-  *Hoffen nhw gwrdd â Sioned? Hoffen* - Would they like to meet Sioned? Yes.\n-  *Hoffen nhw gwrdd â Sioned? Na hoffen* - Would they like to meet Sioned? No.\n\n----\n####Negatives\n\nAs with other verbs, the negative form would take a mixed mutation, but only the soft mutation is required here, and only with *gallu* and *medru*. \n\n-  *Liciwn i ddim cath.* - I wouldn't like a cat.\n-  *Fedrai fe ddim rhedeg i'r siop i nôl bara.* - He would not be able to run to the shop to fetch some bread.\n-  *Allen ni ddim seiclo'r pum deg milltir i Aber erbyn amser cinio.* - We couldn't cycle the fifty miles to Aber by lunch time.\n-  *Fedren nhw ddim dysgu Cymraeg heb lawer o ymarfer.* - They wouldn't be able to learn Welsh without a lot of practice.\n-  *Allet ti ddim ffordio prynu'r car 'na.* - You couldn't afford to buy that car.\n\n----\n**Remember**, too, that *mo* (a contraction of the more formal *ddim o*) is used instead of *ddim* before a definite object:\n\n-  *Hoffwn i mo'r gath 'na.* - I wouldn't like that cat.\n-  *Liciet ti mo'i hen gar brwnt.* - You wouldn't like his dirty old car.\n-  *Hoffech chi mo Sioned â'i ffrindiau hi.* - You wouldn't like Sioned and her friends.\n\n----\n#### Could have, Would have\n\nJust as in the perfect tense 'I have gone' *(Dw i wedi mynd)*, we can say 'I would have been able to...' and 'Dewi would have liked to...'.  We do this by adding *bod wedi* after the subject of the verb, mutating it if it follows directly:\n\n-  *Gallai fe **f**od wedi gyrru.* - He could have driven.\n-  *Hoffai Dewi fod wedi mynd i'r parti.* - Dewi would have liked to have gone to the party.\n-  *Medrwn i fod wedi gwneud hynny i chi.* - I could have done that for you.\n\nIn a negative, the *ddim* takes the mutation, as usual:\n\n-  *Allai fe **dd**im bod wedi gyrru.* - He could not have driven.\n-  *Fedret ti **dd**im bod wedi bwyta cymaint â nhw!* - You could not have eaten as much as them!\n\n----","urlName":"Would-HG"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":36,"id":"b7cb20501d27b8fe937f35fbb9d8bb76","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Comparing2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Compare 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"If you are following ***Cwrs Sylfaen***, these lessons correspond to *Uned 26*.\n\n----\n####Forming and using comparative adjectives\n\nTo compare adjectives, to say something is **-er** than something else, you can normally add ***-ach-*** on the end of the adjective, sometimes with some modifications. For example:\n\n-  *tal* (tall) > *talach* (taller)\n-  *byr* (short) > *byrrach* (shorter) (double *-rr-*)\n-  *twp* (stupid) > *twpach* (more stupid)\n-  *cynnes* (warm) > *cynhesach* (warmer) (note the change of the *-nn-* to *-nh-*)\n-  *gwlyb* > *gwlypach* (wetter) (note the hardening of *-b-* to *-p-*)\n\nThe comparative of longer adjectives is formed in a similar way to English by using ***mwy*** (more):\n\n-  *mwy poblogaidd* - more popular\n-  *mwy ofnadwy* - more terrible\n\nThere are some common exceptions:\n\n-  *bach > **llai*** - small > **smaller/fewer/less**\n-  *mawr > **mwy*** - large/big > **larger/bigger/more**\n-  *da > **gwell*** - good > **better**\n-  *drwg > **gwaeth*** - bad > **worse**\n-  *uchel > **uwch*** - high > **higher**\n-  *isel > **is*** - low > **lower**\n\nIf we want to compare two things, we use *na* for 'than':\n\n-  *Mae Siân yn dalach **na** Siôn* - Siân is taller than Siôn\n \n*na* is followed, like *â, a, gyda* and *tua*, by an aspirate mutation of *p-, t-, c-*:\n\n-  *Mae tŷ'n dalach na char* - A house is taller than a car.\n\nNote that *ti* generally resists mutation:\n\n-  *Mae e'n fwy na ti* - He is bigger than you are\n\n-----\n**Note** that in modern English we usually say 'He is taller than her', or 'He is taller than she is', and those are the patterns used on this course.  \n\n----\n####Forming superlatives\n\nIn a similar way to forming the comparative forms of adjectives, the superlative (**-est**) of adjectives can be formed either by adding ***-a*** (although this is usually* -af* in written Welsh):\n\n-  *gwlyb* (wet) > *gwlypa* (wettest) (note the hardening of *-b-* to *-p-*, the opposite of a soft mutation)\n-  *oer* (cold) > oera (coldest)\n-  *cyfoethog* (rich) > *cyfoethoca* (richest) (note the hardening of *-g-* to *-c-*)\n-  *pert* (pretty) > *perta* (prettiest)\n\nThe superlative of longer adjectives is formed in a similar way to English by using ***mwya*** (most):\n\n-  *mwya poblogaidd* - most popular\n-  *mwya ofnadwy* - most terrible\n\nThere are some common exceptions:\n\n-  *bach > llai > **lleia*** - small > smaller > **smallest**\n-  *mawr > mwy > **mwya*** - large/big > larger/bigger/more > **largest/biggest/most**\n-  *da > gwell > **gorau*** - good > better > **best**\n-  *drwg > gwaeth > **gwaetha*** - bad > worse > **worst**\n\nThe notes and lessons in Comparing3 will show how to use the superlative.\n\n-----\n####Being good at doing things\n\nTo say that someone is good at something, there is a very simple pattern using ***da am*** (good at):\n\n-  *Mae Sioned yn **dda am** redeg* - Sioned is **good at** running\n-  *Roedden nhw'n dda am chemeg yn yr ysgol* - They used to be good at chemistry at school\n-  *Bydd Eleri'n dda am ddysgu Cymraeg i'r myfyrwyr* - Eleri will be good at teaching Welsh to the students\n\n**Remember** that there is a weak soft mutation after this usage of *yn* (no mutation of *ll-* or *rh-*).\n\n**Remember** that there is a soft mutation after *am*.\n\n----","urlName":"Comparing2"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"7ee0f185db9a65f2c077fae2726509a5","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Dates 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Dates 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####Dates\n\nSo far, we have introduced numbers using the newer decimal system:  *un, dau, deg, un deg un, dau ddeg,* and so on.

For example:\n\n-  *Gareth yw'r **g**orau.* - Gareth is the best.  ...but\n-  *Siân yw'r **_**orau.* - Siân is the best.\n\nIn the case of *gorau*, the **g** mutates away for Siân as she is feminine. Other examples include:\n\n-  *Fe yw'r **t**lota.* - He is the poorest. ... but\n-  *Sioned yw'r **d**lota.* - Sioned is the poorest.\n-  *Fe yw'r **t**ala.* - He is the tallest. ... but\n-  *Hi yw'r **d**ala.* - She is the tallest.\n\nSimilarly if *mwya* is used:\n\n-  *Hi ydy'r un **f**wya poblogaidd yn y tîm* - She is the most popular one in the team.  But:\n-  *Fe ydy'r un **m**wya poblogaidd yn y tîm* - He is the most popular one in the team.\n\n----\nWhen asking a question about whether someone is the tallest, or whether a thing is the most expensive and so on, a question must start with the person or thing, as with any emphatic question:\n\n-  *Aled yw'r tala? Ie.* - Is Aled the tallest?  Yes.\n-  *Y BMW ydy'r car mwya drud yn y garej?* - Is the BMW the most expensive car in the garage?\n-  *Sioned ydy'r ferch dala yn y tîm?  Nage.* - Is Sioned the tallest girl in the team?  No.\n-  *Pwy yw'r person cyflyma yn y gystadleuaeth hyd yn hyn?* - Who is the fastest in the competition so far?\n\n----\nNote that in Welsh, unlike in English, we use the superlative  form ** *(-a, -af)* ** to say that something or someone is the taller/shorter/better/etc of two as well as the tallest/shortest/best/etc of three or more:\n\n-  *Cymru neu'r Alban, pa un ydy'r fwya?* - Wales or Scotland, which is the larger?  (Note that countries are feminine in gender, so *mwya* has been mutated to *fwya* here)\n-  *Cymru, yr Alban neu Ddenmarc, pa un ydy'r fwyaf?* - Wales, Scotland or Denmark, which is the largest?\n-  *Eleri neu Dewi, pwy ydy'r tala?* - Eleri or Dewi, who is the taller?\n\n----\n####Using an emphatic clause as the second part of a sentence - *mai/taw*\n\nWhen using **that** in the middle of a two-part sentence where the second part is emphatic, the verb ***bod*** changes to the particle ***mai/taw***.   This allows us to use another, separate verb in the second part of the sentence, maintaining its emphatic structure.  For example:\n\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **bod** Megan yn dal*   - but,\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **mai** Megan **ydy**'r dala.*\n\nSimilarly with clauses that use *sy*:\n\n-  *Dw i'n meddwl **mai** fi **sy**'n araf.*\n\n-  *Dw i'n gwybod fod ti'n siarad* means 'I know that you're speaking' but:\n-   *Dw i'n gwybod **mai ti** sy'n siarad* means 'I know that it is **you** who is speaking. \n\nNote the use of ** *sy'n* ** after the pronoun or proper noun. \n\nSimilarly, *Dw i'n gwybod **taw** ti sy'n siarad* is also correct -  *taw* often being used instead of *mai* in west and south Wales. \n\n----\n*mai/taw* can also be used with other tenses, and the translation will also change according to the tense used. For example:\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n meddwl mai **ti** oedd yn anghywir.* - I thought that it was **you** who was wrong.\n-  *Roedd e'n credu taw **Dewi** fasai'n ymadael yn gynnar.* - He believed that **Dewi** would leave early.\n-  *Mae Sarah yn gobeithio mai **Jack** fydd yn dod i'r parti. - *Sarah hopes that it is **Jack** who will be coming to the party.\n\n----","urlName":"Comparing3"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"6bf0713f6d64557d0df94d9822e66c73","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Dates 2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Dates 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####More on the older vigesimal counting system\n\nFollowing on from the first section on numbers used in dates, here is a full table of the numbers 10 to 31 in the vigesimal system.

(Implied - and I still work here now)\n-  They have lived there since 2005.  (Implied - and they still do)\n\nIn Welsh we use the word *ers* and the present tense of *bod* for this meaning, rather than the present perfect.

Instead we have to use a pattern similar to 'nothing of' in English - ***ddim o***, which is almost always abbreviated to ***mo***\n\n-  *Welais i ddim ffilm* - I didn't see **a film**, but\n-  *Welais i **mo'r** ffilm* - I didn't see **the film**\n-  *Welais i mo Dewi neithiwr* - I didn't see Dewi last night\n-  *Ddarllenais i mo'i stori hi wrthyn nhw* - I didn't read her story to them  *(ddim + o + ei = mo'i)*\n-  *Pheintias i mo'r lolfa ddoe* - I didn't paint the lounge yesterday\n\n----\n####Being 'really happy'\nThe word ***bodd*** (pleasure) is used along with ***wrth +* possessive pronouns** which mutate the *b-* to express the idea of being 'really happy' about something. \n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Dw i wrth fy modd yn fy swydd newydd.* - I am really happy in my new job.\n-  *Roeddet ti wrth dy fodd yn Aber.* - You were really happy in Aber.\n\nThe forms are (and note the plural form *boddau* which is often used with plural pronouns):\n\n-  *wrth fy modd*\n-  *wrth dy fodd*\n-  *wrth ei fodd*\n-  *wrth ei bodd*\n-  *wrth ein bodd/boddau*\n-  *wrth eich bodd/boddau*\n-  *wrth eu bodd/boddau*\n\n----","urlName":"That"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":6,"id":"d5f34691c2edc9cd1564ad4a91b16dbe","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Revision5","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Revision 5","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"The aim of this section is to revise patterns already covered, to extend their application, and to introduce additional vocabulary.\n\n----\n***Llongyfarchiadau!*** Congratulations!\n\nHaving reached this far means that you've covered *Cwrs Mynediad* and *Cwrs Sylfaen*, which normally takes up to four years in a community education setting! *Dal ati* - Keep at it!\n\n*Mae'r uned hon yn dod â'r pum uned ddiwethaf at ei gilydd.*\n\nThis unit brings the last five units together.\n\n----","urlName":"Revision5"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":15,"id":"3f66150999361f8727e8e32fea9fca80","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Conditional2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Cond. 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"----\n####Some British expressions\n\nWe realise that there are many people using this course who are not familiar with some British activities , so here are some notes which may help.\n\n**A coffee morning** is a morning social gathering at which coffee or tea is available.

Often, a positive answer is expected when a sentence tag such as this is used. \n\nThe form *oni* is used before consonants, and *on'd* before vowels. (You may sometimes see *on'd* written in full as *onid* in more formal Welsh.) *Oni* causes 'mixed mutation' - aspirate of *p, t, c*, and soft of *b, d, g, m, ll, rh*. \n\nSome examples:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n bwrw glaw, on'd yw hi? Ydy.* - It's raining, isn't it? Yes, it is.\n-  *Roedd hi'n heulog ddoe, on'd oedd hi? Oedd.* - It was sunny yesterday, wasn't it? Yes, it was.\n-  *Bydd hi'n mynd yfory, oni **f**ydd hi? Bydd.* - She'll be going tomorrow, won't she?  Yes.\n-  *Mae teigr yn yr ardd eto, on'd oes?  Oes!* - There's a tiger in the garden again, isn't there?  Yes!\n\n*Note* that an emphatic statement, typically about names, jobs and roles, uses a tag of *ife?* or *on'd ife*:\n\n-  *Dewi yw e, on'd ife?* - He's Dewi, isn't he?\n-  *Athrawes ydy hi, on'd ife?* - She's a teacher, isn't she?\n\nIt can also be used to frame a question:\n\n-  *On'd ydy Siôn yn mynd i'r siopiau?  Ydy.* - Isn't Siôn going to the shops?  Yes, he is.\n-  *On'd ydy'r glaw wedi gorffen eto?  Nac ydy, dim eto* - Hasn't the rain stopped yet? No, not yet.\n\n----\nIn Lesson 2, the sentence tags for **you know?** are taught and can be used to fill out your sentences. Two versions from the many that are used have been included:\n\n-   *t'mod?* and *ch'mod?* both mean 'you know?' and are shortened forms of *wyt ti'n gwybod?* and *dych chi'n gwybod?*. These are generally heard more in south and west Wales than in the north.\n-  *'sti?* and *'wchi?* (or *'chi?*) again mean *you know?* but they are generally heard more in north and mid-Wales.  They are shortened forms of *wyddost ti?* and *wyddoch chi?* '(do you know?').\n\n----\nThere are many more sentence tags that are used in Welsh, so this unit is just to give you an basic idea of how they work.  If you watch or listen to the Welsh media you will come across many more.\n\n----\n####A need - *Angen*\n\nLike *eisiau*, *angen* is a noun, not a verb-noun, and it is used in the same exceptional pattern as *eisiau*, with no linking *'n/yn*:\n\n-  *Dw i angen morthwyl.* - I need a hammer.\n-  *Dw i eisiau morthwyl.* - I want a hammer.\n-  *Maen nhw angen gwyliau.* - They need a holiday.\n-  *Maen nhw eisiau gwyliau.* - They want a holiday.\n\n----","urlName":"SentenceTags"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":6,"id":"9ffc1e170241082bb8238c58a1cd32a3","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Adverbs2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Adverbs 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"These lessons show how to describe actions with adverbs, especially about **how** we do things - this a a revision and extension of Adverbs1.  \n\nThe last lesson also introduces the the preposition *am* ('about', or sometimes 'for').\n\n----\n####Adverbs - describing how and when we do things\n\nWe often need to say how, when, where or why we do things, and we do this by using adverbs:\n\n-  I ran **quickly**.\n-  I held **tightly** onto the rope.\n-  She shouted **loudly**.\n-  They explained things **clearly**.\n\nOne way of doing this in Welsh is to create the adverb from an adjective by putting *yn/'n* between the verb and the adjective:\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n aros **yn amyneddgar*** - I was waiting **patiently** (*amyneddgar* - patient -> *yn amyneddgar* - patient**ly**)\n-  *Bydd hi'n bwrw glaw**'n drwm*** - It will be raining **heavily** (*trwm* - heavy)\n\n**Remember** that *yn* causes a weak soft mutation of a following noun or adjective (no mutation of *ll-, rh-*)\n\nWhile the method shown above is a simple way of creating adverbs, there are other expressions which can describe how and we do things - they don't all use *yn*:\n\n-  *ar frys* - in a hurry/rush\n-  *mewn penbleth* - in confusion\n-  *o gwmpas* - around\n-  *ddydd Llun* - on Monday\n-  *ar ddydd Llun* - on Mondays\n\n-  *Ro'n i'n rhedeg o gwmpas y dref ar frys ddydd Llun* - I was running around town in a rush on Monday\n\n**Note** that adverbs saying **when** we do things are usually mutated:\n\n-  *Es i yno **dd**oe* - yesterday (the original *doe* is not seen in the modern language)\n-  *Gwela i ti **dd**ydd Gwener* - I'll see you on Friday\n-  *wastad* - always (from *gwastad*)\n-  *Gwnes i fe **dd**wywaith* - I did it **twice**\n-  *Roedden ni'n mynd yno **b**ob wythnos* - we used to go there **every week**\n-  *Aeth hi yno **f**lwyddyn yn ôl* - she went there **a year ago**\n\nWe may also need to say **why** we do things - that will be covered later in the course.\n\n-----\n####*Am* (about, for) - how it changes with the person to whom it refers\n\n*Am* is one of several Welsh prepositions that take additional endings in front of personal pronouns:\n\n-  *Mae Siân yn aros **am** y bws* - Siân is waiting **for** the bus\n-  *Mae hi'n aros **am** ei phlant* - she is waiting **for** her children\n\nVery straightforward.  But what if she is waiting for you?\n\n-  *Mae Siân yn aros **amdanat ti*** - Siân is waiting **for you**\n-  *Mae Sian yn aros **amdanoch chi** i gyd* - Siân is **waiting for you** all.\n\nNow she is searching for Dewi, or her gloves:\n\n-  *Mae hi'n chwilio amdano fe/fo* - she is searching for him (*chwilio am* - to search for)\n-  *Mae hi'n chwilio amdanyn nhw* - she is searching for them\n\n----\nIn full, this is how *am* conjugates:\n\n-  *amdana i* - for/about me\n-  *amdanat ti* - for/about you (singular familiar)\n-  *amdano fe/fo* - for/about him\n-  *amdani hi* - for/about her\n-  *amdanon ni* - for/about us\n-  *amdanoch chi* - for/about you (formal or plural)\n-  *amdanyn nhw* - for/about them\n\nThose are the common forms used on this course - you may come across minor variations elsewhere.\n\n----\n**Remember** that in Welsh, as in other languages, there are words which can have more than one meaning.  In this unit, for example you will meet *ysgol* - 'a ladder', or 'a school'.\n\n-----\n(**Note**  - For those people who already know some Welsh, please note that this course does not cover the more formal forms of the language where the pronouns may get dropped - responses without the pronouns may not always be accepted.)\n\n----\n####Ever or never - *byth, erioed*\n\nAs a reminder, *byth* and *erioed* are used to mean both 'ever' and 'never', depending on the context.  In a negative sentence they can be used in place of *ddim* to mean 'never'.  They are used with particular tenses:\n\n-  *erioed* is used with completed tenses in the past - the present perfect, the simple past and the pluperfect.\n-  *byth* is used with other tenses - the present, future, imperfect past and the conditional.\n\nFor example:\n\n-  *Dyw hi byth yn mynd yno.  Dyw hi ddim yn mynd yno byth.* - She never goes there.\n-  *Doedd hi byth yn mynd yno.

Children are encouraged to be creative and imaginative and learn by taking part in practical activities instead of working through exercises in textbooks. This Phase includes Nursery *(yr Ysgol Feithrin)* and Reception *(y Dosbarth Derbyn)* (see -http://www.theschoolrun.com/overview-welsh-education-system).\n\nKey Stage 1 sees the start of compulsory education age and pupils are aged 5 - 7.\n\nKS2 sees the second phase of compulsory education and pupils are aged 7 - 11. KS1 and KS2 (Years 1 to 6) are taught in Primary Schools *(Ysgolion Cynradd)*.\n\nKS3 sees the first phase of compulsory secondary education (***addysg uwchradd***) and pupils are aged 11 - 14. This KS includes Years 7, 8, and 9.\n\nKS4 sees the last phase of compulsory secondary education (and education in general) and pupils are aged 15 - 16. This KS includes Years 10 and 11 and is called GCSE - General Certificate of Secondary Education (***TGAU - Tystysgrif Gyffredinol Addysg Uwchradd***). KS3 and KS4 (Years 7 to 11) are taught in Secondary Schools.\n\nAfter compulsory education, pupils who qualify can continue post-16 education (***addysg ôl-16***) at Six Form (***y Chweched Dosbarth***) or College (***y Coleg***) (both termed as FE - Further Education / ***AB - Addysg Bellach***)), take Apprenticeships (***Prentisiaethau***), or start in the world of work, and eventually move on to University (***Prifysgol***) (termed as HE - Higher Education, ***AU - Addysg Uwch***).\n\nAt the time of writing *(mis Mehefin 2016)*, the Welsh Government, lead by Professor Graham Donaldson, is restructuring the whole curriculum from the Foundation Phase to GCSE. This new curriculum will be available for implementation from *mis Medi 2018* onwards and is hoped to be fully implemented by *yr haf 2021*.\n\n----\n####Medium of education\nIn Wales, schools at each level are often described by their 'medium of education', that is, the language through which the education is provided.  Schools can be 'Welsh-medium', 'Bilingual' or 'English-medium'.\n\nIn this sense, the word for 'medium' is *cyfrwng*, as in *addysg cyfrwng Cymraeg* (Welsh-medium education).  However, that is not needed in expressions such as *ysgol Gymraeg* (a Welsh-medium school) or *ysgol Saesneg* (an English-medium school), where *Cymraeg* or *Saesneg* are used as adjectives meaning Welsh/English-medium.\n\nAll schools in Wales teach Welsh (termed as \"Welsh second language\" in English-medium schools *(ysgolion Saesneg)* and as \"Welsh first language\" in Welsh-medium schools *(ysgolion Cymraeg)*.\n\nIn 2016, there were 65,460 pupils in primary education who received their education through the medium of the Welsh language, which equates to 24% of the overall total. 36,485 pupils in secondary education also received their education though the medium of Welsh, which equates to 20% of the overall total.\n\n----","urlName":"Education1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":26,"id":"95ba720c53a356aef5b7dc3301a5aee8","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"TheHome1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Home 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This section introduces some vocabulary to use about the home, and it gives an opportunity to practice some patterns and rules you have met already.\n\nAbout a third of Welsh nouns are feminine, and although there are some rough guides as to how to recognise them, there are also many exceptions.  The best thing is to learn the gender of nouns as you first meet them.  If you make lists of the words that you learn, note those that are feminine.  \n\nIt is also useful to look up and note down the plurals, too - [*Gweiadur Pawb*](http://gweiadur.com) and [*Geiriadur yr Academi*](http://geiriaduracademi.org) are useful on-line dictionaries to help you.  The Gweiadur gives both Welsh to English and English to Welsh, it often has examples of how the words are used, and it often has real voice recordings of the pronunciation of the Welsh words.\n\n----\n####Soft mutations and feminine nouns\n\nFirstly, the definite article *y/yr/'r* causes weak soft mutation of feminine nouns (that is, it does not cause mutation of words beginning with *ll-* or *rh-*).\n\nSecondly, remember that an adjective following a feminine noun undergoes soft mutation.  \n\nSome feminine nouns used about the home include:\n\n-  *lolfa (lolfeydd)* - a lounge (lounges)\n-  *cegin (ceginau)* -  a kitchen (kitchens)\n-  *ystafell (ystafelloedd)* - a room\n-  *cadair (cadeiriau)* - a chair\n-  *gardd (gerddi)* - a garden\n\nRemember that plural nouns lose their singular gender, so they do not undergo, or cause, either of the mutations mentioned above.\n\nSo:\n\n-  *y lolfa fawr* - the big lounge\n-  *ystafell fyw* - a living room\n-  *y gegin fawr* - the large kitchen\n-  *yr ystafell wely fach* - the small bedroom\n-  *yr ardd daclus fach* - the small, tidy garden\n-  *y llen liwgar* - the colourful curtain\n\nBut:\n\n-  *y lolfeydd mawr* - the large lounges\n-  *ystafelloedd byw* - living rooms\n-  *y ceginau mawr* - the big kitchens\n-  *ystafelloedd gwely bach* - small bedrooms\n-  *y gerddi taclus bach* - the small, tidy gardens\n-  *y llenni lliwgar* - the colourful curtains","urlName":"TheHome1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":35,"id":"f5cdcbffde7f9150c01fb4252dec8254","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Cult&Lang","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Culture","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"####The 'something' of the 'something' pattern\nThe Welsh *xxx **y** zzz* translates into English as '**the** xxx **of the** zzz'.

It is held in a different location each year, alternating between the main regions of Wales. [For example](https://eisteddfod.wales/about-us/past-locations), Cardiff in south-central Wales (2018), Anglesey, north-west Wales (2017), Abergavenny, Monmouthshire in south-east Wales (2016), Meifod, Powys in mid-Wales (2015), Denbigh, north-east Wales (2014) and the Vale of Glamorgan in south-central Wales (2013),  It attracts people from all over Wales, the UK, and beyond and it is the largest cultural festival in Europe. There are some traditional events, such as the 'Chairing of the Bard', which are performed during the week-long event.  There are many concerts, including live gigs and music performances held in ***Maes B***.  Learners of the language can meet up and attend events tailored for them in ***Maes D*** on the main site.  You can read more about the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol [here](https://eisteddfod.cymru),\n\n***Eisteddfod yr Urdd*** is for school-age children, with competitions in many areas of interest, including dance, recital, poetry, and technology.  Details of the Urdd Eisteddfod are [here](http://www.urdd.cymru/cy/)\n\nThere is also an international Eisteddfod (***Eisteddfod Ryngwladol***) held in Llangollen every year, which attracts performers from all over the world to compete. There is more information [here](http://international-eisteddfod.co.uk/cy/).\n\n----\n**Saunders Lewis** is an important character in the history of Welsh language; he was a language activist who fiercely defended his rights, and the rights of others, to use Welsh. He did this by putting pressure on the Government and by founding ***Plaid Cymru***, 'the Party of Wales'. In 1962, he gave a radio speech entitled *'Tynged yr Iaith'*, or 'The Fate of the Language'.  With this speech, he intended to motivate the members of Plaid Cymru into more direct action in promoting the language; however, it led to the formation of *Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg*, the Welsh Language Society, which is now well-known for its non-violent, direct protests for the rights of Welsh speakers and Welsh language services in Wales.

Instead, people now tend to use more durable, longer-lived shopping bags, nick-named 'bags for life' - the life of the bag, anyway:\n\n-  *bag am oes* - a bag for life\n\n----\n####The 'checkout' or 'cash desk'\n\n-  *y ddesg talu* - the checkout, the cash desk\n\n*desg* is a feminine noun - we can tell that because it mutates after *y*.

This was introduced earlier in the course as an adjective meaning 'new', but it is also used in place of *wedi* to convey the meaning of having 'just' (done something).  In this context it is followed by a soft mutation:\n\n-  *Dyn ni newydd gyrraedd.* - We have just arrived. *(cyrraedd)*\n-  *Mae Sioned newydd orffen y gwaith.* - Sioned has just finished the work.  *(gorffen)*\n-  *Roedd hi newydd **f**ynd* - She had just gone. *(mynd)*\n-  *Roedd e newydd allgofnodi pan aeth y cyfrifiadur ar dân.* - He had just logged off when the computer caught fire.\n\nThe use of *Cymraeg* in technology (***technoleg***) has come a long way in recent years with the roll out of broadband (***band llydan***) to Wales and more rural areas.\n\nThe use of *Cymraeg* on-line (***ar-lein***) has boomed in the past decade as well, with the following being available partly or fully in *Cymraeg*:\n\n1.

In Welsh there are particular words we use for this:\n\n-  ***dyma*** (this is) and \n-  ***dyna*** (that is)\n\n**Note** that the endings are the same as *yma/'ma* (here, this) and *yna/'na* (there, that):\n\n-  *y car 'ma* - this car\n-  *dyma'r car* - 'this is the car' or 'here's the car'\n-  *y gath 'na* - that cat\n-  *dyna'r gath* - 'that's the cat', or 'there's the cat'\n\n**Note** that both *dyma* and *dyna* cause a soft mutation:\n\n-  *dyma gar* - here's a car\n-  *dyna gath* - there's a cat\n\n----\nYou will also come across these words in colloquial expressions such as :\n\n-  *Wel, dyna ni, 'te.* - Well, there we are, then.\n-  *Dyma ddiwedd y wers...* - Here's the end of the lesson...\n\n----\n####Compound words\n\nIn common with many other languages, Welsh can make compound words from two or more other words or prefixes or suffixes.  This unit introduces one example from the English - 'biodegradable':\n\n-  *diraddio* - to degrade, to break down into parts\n\nWe can drop the *-o* and add an ending similar to '-able' in English - *-adwy*:\n\n-  *diraddi**adwy*** - degrade**able**\n\nA taking it a step further by adding the prefix *bio-*:\n\n-  *bio**dd**iraddiadwy* - biodgradeable - we have added *bio-* just as in the English.  \n\nNotice that the *d-* of the original *diraddio* has mutated to *dd-* following the prefix.  This is very common in the pattern of compound words in Welsh.\n\nSo, even if a long word looks very complex, you can often break it down into its component parts to make sense of it.\n\n(**Note** that in this particular word, the  middle *-i* is often also dropped, so you will usually see the form *bioddiraddadwy*, but both are valid.)\n\n----","urlName":"Nature"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":8,"id":"4ffa080a26dfe30a10d6832f2f9ffaa0","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Banking","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Banking","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"The section introduces some terms to do with banking and making payments.\n\n----\n####Contactless payments\nA rapidly spreading technology, especially in Britain, allows payments of small amounts of money, up to a few tens of pounds usually, to be made by payment card or by a smart-phone app without having to enter any details such as PIN codes.

Evidence of their death rituals can be seen in dolmens *(cromlechi)*, prehistoric megaliths *(megalithau cynhanesyddol)* that typically have two or three upright stones and a capstone.  They are thought to be burial chambers *(siamberi claddu)* and, according to archaelologists, they are among the earliest permanent structures built by people, even older than the pyramids of Egypt. There are around 150 dolmens in Cymru, the most notable being at Pentre Ifan in Preseli, Pembrokeshire.  Pentre Ifan is the cover design on Duolingo's Welsh page.\n\nPembrokeshire *(sir Benfro)* also has a link with the most famous stone circle in Britain, that at Stonehenge (*Côr y Cewri*, lit: The Giants' Choir), as its inner circle consists of bluestones *(cerrig gleision)*, apparently from the Preseli hills close to Pentre Ifan.\n\n(Information adapted from this BBC article - http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/religion/religion_pre_christian_wales.shtml)\n\nIn current Cymru, according to the 2011 UK Census, Christianity *(Cristnogaeth)* is the country's largest religion with about 58% of respondents claiming to be Christian (adj. *Cristnogol*, noun *Cristion (Cristnogion)*), despite falling numbers.  Until 1920, the established church *(eglwys)*, in common with England, was the Anglican *(Anglicanaidd)* Church of England, when it was formally disestablished in Wales, becoming the Church in Wales *(yr Eglwys yng Nghymru)*.  However, Wales has a strong tradition of nonconformism (***anghydffurfiaeth***) and Methodism (***Methodistiaeth***).  Many non-conformists worship in chapels *(capeli)* rather than churches *(eglwysi)*, and the distinction between Church and Chapel remains strong.\n\nMuslims *(Mwslimiaid)* are the next biggest religious group, making up 1.5% of the population according to the 2011 census. \n\nMeanwhile the proportion of the population who reported they have no religion *(dim crefydd)* had reached about 32%.\n\nOther religions include Paganism, Buddhism (*Bwdhaeth)*, Hinduism *(Hindŵaeth)*, Judaism *(Iddewiaeth)*, Islam, Sikhism *(Siciaeth)*, and Druidism *(Derwyddiaeth)*.

Mae Dewi'n ei siarad **hi**'n dda*\n\nBut when we are describing their attributes they are treated as masculine:\n\n-  *Cymraeg coeth* - excellent/refined Welsh\n-  *Almaeneg da* - good German\n-  *Cymraeg cyfoes* - modern/contemporary Welsh\n-  *Saesneg Canol* - Middle English\n\n----","urlName":"Medicine"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":4,"id":"e42a5892cd8dbc9bf9c0007d628b1c35","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"TheArts","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"The Arts","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":null,"urlName":"TheArts"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":26,"id":"4fba451d75597c5caac58e0ea3d81cb0","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Fashion","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Fashion","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":null,"urlName":"Fashion"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":7,"id":"09ce3f29c41310a0cdf3c9e3bf4c7aa3","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Science","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Science","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Science, including mathematics, has a rich history of Welsh inventors.\n\n**Isaac Roberts**, an astronomer (***seryddwr***) born in Groes in Denbighshire (***Groes yn Sir Ddinbych***), was the first to take a clear deep space photograph of what was then labelled a nebula (***nifwl***), and discovered that it was spiral in shape. He discovered that our closest neighbouring galaxy (***galaeth***), Andromeda, is spiral in shape.\n\n**Alfred Russel Wallace**, born in Llanbadoc in Monmouthshire (***Llanbadog Fawr yn sir Fynwy***), helped Charles Darwin redefine theory of evolution (***damcaniaeth esblygiad***).\n\n**David Edward Hughes**, born in Corwen in Denbighshire (***Corwen yn Sir Ddinbych***), refined the idea of a microphone (***microffon***) as a way of electronically transmitting an acoustic signal, and paved the way for the modern microphone after Edison invented the idea of the microphone when he placed the carbon telephone transmitter inside a telephone (***ffôn, teleffôn***).\n\n**Edward George Bowen**, born in Cockett in Swansea (***y Cocyd yn Abertawe***), was one of the men who developed the radar that could be used to detect aircraft (***awyrennau***). He eventually managed to install radar in aircraft and went on to trying to detect submarines (***llongau tanfor***) by radar during World War II (***yr Ail Ryfel Byd***).\n\n**Donald Davies**, born in Treorcy in the Rhondda (***Treorci yn y Rhondda***), developed the idea of sending large amounts of data across the world by breaking it up into smaller packets (***pecynnau***) of data which move independently through a series of networks (***rhwydweithiau***).\n\n**Robert Recorde**, born in Tenby in Pembrokeshire (***Dinbych-y-pysgod, Sir Benfro***), was the first person to use the modern equals (= ***hafalnod***) and plus (+ ***adio, plws***) signs in a publication. He also produced the first English language book on algebra. On the subject of mathematics, William Jones, born on *Ynys Môn* (Anglesey) in 1675, invented the modern symbol for Pi.\n\nAdapted from Wales Online [here](http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/ten-welsh-inventions-wales-gave-2601007).\n\n----\n####British English usage - gases\nIn British English usage, 'gases' is the plural form of the noun 'gas', and nothing to do with filling a vehicle's fuel tank.\n\n----\n####Short form present/future of *gallu/medru*\n\nIn more formal registers of written and spoken Welsh, most verbs have a short-form present/future (or 'non-past') tense.  With *gallu* and *medru*, this tense is sometimes used in the colloquial language as well.  For example, in the third person singular:\n\n-  *Gall e siarad Ffrangeg yn rhugl.*. He can speak French fluently.\n-  *Medr hi ddatrys y broblemau.* - She can solve the problems.\n\nThese two forms will be used occasionally in the latter parts of this course.\n\n----","urlName":"Science"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":11,"id":"7b3d8af1643a8fe4f7a8c2a3f5baed81","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Politics","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Politics","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces vocabulary for political parties and other political terms.\n\n----\n####Saying that someone has just done something\n\nThe word *newydd* has already come up as an adjective meaning 'new'.  However, it can also be used as an adverb following forms of *bod* to mean 'just' as in 'I have just washed the car'.  In this pattern it replaces *wedi* and causes soft mutation:\n\n-  *Dw i newydd olchi'r car.* - I have just washed the car.\n-  *Dw i newydd sefyll yr arholiad.* - I have just sat the exam.\n-  *Maen nhw newydd gwblhau'r pos.* - They have just finished the puzzle.\n-  *Bydd Dewi newydd orffen gwaith am  ddeg o'r gloch heno.* - Dewi will have just finished work at ten o'clock this evening.\n\n----\n####Expressions such as *Senedd Cymru* ('the Welsh Parliament')\n\nNote that in Welsh we do not use the definite article *y* ('the') in front of two proper nouns put together to form a proper noun phrase such as *Senedd Cymru*.\n\n----\n####The Senedd\n\nAs an institution, the national elected body of Wales was renamed *Senedd Cymru* in May 2020.  It was formerly known as *Cynulliad Cymru* (the Welsh Assembly). In English it is now known as 'Welsh Parliament', or more often just 'the Senedd'. See https://senedd.wales/en/abthome/Pages/abthome.aspx\n\nThere may have been a short-lived parliament during Owen Glyndŵr's time in the Middle Ages, although the building in Machynlleth where it was once reputed to have been held is now known to date to some time after Glyndŵr.\n\nAs a word on its own, *senedd* simply translates as 'a parliament' or 'a senate'.\n\nWales has had regular representation in the Westminster parliament since 1536.  The Westminster parliament is usually known informally in Welsh as *San Steffan* after the St Stephen's entrance to the House of Commons.\n\n----\n####Forms of address - personal titles\n\n*y* is also used in front of people's professional and honorary titles, where it represent a form of address:\n\n-  *Yr Athro ap Gwilym* - Professor ap Gwilym\n-  *Y Doethur Tudur Jones* - Dr Tudur Jones\n-  *Yr Arglwydd Wigley* - Lord Wigley\n\nThis is also used when addressing praise (or not!) to  someone:\n\n-  *Y seren!* - You star!\n-  *Yr arwr!* - You hero!\n-  *Y druan!* - You poor thing!\n-  *Y ionc!* - You twit!\n\n----\n####Welsh Government and politics\n\nFollowing a series of devolutions, the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland now have their own parliaments or assemblies with some devolved powers and the ability to make local laws covering some subjects.  Wales was granted devolution in 1999.\n\nThese parliaments/assemblies are responsible for a wide range of devolved powers. As at Jun 2016, Wales has twenty subjects of devolved power, including Health, Education, Social welfare, Environment, Economic development and Culture.  A new devolution agreement for Wales is currently (June 2016) under discussion.\n\n----\n####Political parties in Wales\nThe main political parties in Wales following the Assembly elections of 2016 are:\n\n-  *y Blaid Lafur* - The Labour Party\n-  *y Blaid Geidwadol* - The Conservative Party\n-  *Plaid Cymru* -  Plaid Cymru (the Welsh nationalist party, literally - 'the Party of Wales', but it is not usually translated into English)\n-  *Plaid y Democratiaid Rhydfrydol* - the Liberal Democratic Party - (lit - 'the Party of the Liberal Democrats')\n-  *PADU (Plaid Annibyniaeth y Deyrnas Unedig)* - UKIP (the United Kingdom Independence Party)\n\nIn the names of the parties, note that we only use *y* in front of those where the noun *Plaid* is followed by an adjective *(llafur, ceidwadol)* rather than by another noun (*Cymru, Annibyniaeth*)\n\nRemember that *Plaid* is a feminine noun, so that it mutates after *y*, and itself causes mutation of a following adjective:\n\n-  *y Blaid **L**afur*\n-  *y Blaid **G**eidwadol*\n\n----","urlName":"Politics"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":24,"id":"f0fa01ffab4dc81b8c56a173d6bcc085","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Reporting Back C7","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Reporting","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit teaches how to report what someone else has said.\n\nIt also teaches how to explain that something must be so.\n\n----\n####Reporting what someone else said or wrote.\n\nQuite simply, we use the same pattern that was introduced earlier in 'Expressing Opinions':\n\n-  *Dwedodd hi (ei) bod hi'n mynd i Aber yfory.* - She said that she is/was going to Aber tomorrow.\n-  *Ysgrifennais i (fy) mod i wedi cwrdd ag Owen ddoe.* - I wrote that I had met Owen yesterday.\n-  *Dwedodd o (y) basai Owen yn hoffi dod efo ni i Aber.* - He said that Owen would like to come with us to Aber.\n-  *Dwedodd Sam (y) dylai hi'n ymarfer yn amlach.* - Sam said that she should practise more often.\n\n**Note** that you may need to be careful about which tense you use in the English translation - be sure that it makes sense.\n\n**Note** that *bod, etc* is only used to introduce a sub-clause that uses the present or imperfect tenses of *bod*.\n\n**Note that the *(y)* used in the last two examples is not the same as *'r/yr/y* ('the').  It is a particle which is used to link to verbs in certain tenses of *bod*, including the conditional, as here.  It is often omitted in the colloquial language, as shown by the brackets. It does not itself cause a mutation.\n\n**Note** that the rule about the object of a short-form verb taking a soft mutation applies here (look back to the sections on the past of *cael* and *gwneud*, for example).  In the examples just given, the *ei, fy* and *y* 'shield' the following word (usually a form of *bod* here) from mutation as an object, although they may cause their own mutation even if they are omitted.  If there is no 'shielding' word, the soft mutation of the 'object' takes effect:\n\n-  *Dwedodd y dyn **f**od y gadair yn rhy ddrud.* - The man said that the chair was too expensive. (*bod* takes the soft mutation)\n-  *Clywais i **f**od y dyn yn grintach.* - I heard that the man was mean.\n\n----\n####*Rhaid bod...* - It must be...\n\nEarlier in the course you met the pattern *Rhaid i...* to say that something must happen:\n\n-  *Rhaid i fi fynd i gwrdd ag Owen yn y caffi nes ymlaen*.  -  I must meet Owen at the cafe later.\n\nWe also use *rhaid* - but followed by *bod, etc* - to give an explanation of things:\n\n-  *Dyw Owen ddim yma eto - rhaid bod ei drên yn hwyr.* - Owen isn't here yet - his train must be late.\n-  *Mae pawb yn gwisgo cotiau trwm heddiw - rhaid (ei) bod hi'n oer iawn tu allan.* - Everyone is wearing heavy coats today - it must be very cold outside.\n-  *Da iawn ti am dy ddyrchafiad yn y cwmni; rhaid (dy) fod ti wedi gweithio'n galed iawn.* - Well done on your promotion in the company; you must have worked very hard.\n-  *Edrycha ar y barrug ar y coed; rhaid (ei) bod hi wedi bod yn oer iawn dros nos.*  - Look at the frost on the trees; it must have been very cold overnight.\n-  *Am bannas blasus!
