Camp","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Boot Camp","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Hello & welcome to Duolingo's course in Klingon!\n---\nWe would like to tell you \"Hello and welcome\" in Klingon, but Klingon does not have equivalents to those words. Klingons tend to be very direct and rarely engage in conversation simply for the pleasure of conversing, making superfluous many of the pleasantries we are accustomed to using in English.\n\nIn this unit we will focus on getting you using Klingon right away.\n\nAlphabet\n---\nThe Klingon alphabet is:  \n**a b ch D e gh H I j l m n ng o p q Q r S t tlh u v w y '**\n\nNote that case matters: many letters are *always* lowercase (even at the beginning of a sentence) & some are *always* uppercase (even in the middle of a word).\n\nPronunciation:\n---\nLetters **b l m n p t** & **v** are said as in English, but **b, p** & **t** should always have a puff of air, even at the end of a word.\n\nVowels each have one pronunciation.  \n**a** as in father  \n**e** as in ten  \n**I** as in it  \n**o** as in bowl  \n**u** as the oo in pool\n\n**I** is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels we often see in foreign languages.\n\n**H** is said at the top of the throat with a raspy vibration in the back of the mouth, but without any voiced hum in the throat or nasals. It is similar to the \"ch\" heard in Scottish \"loch\", Hebrew \"l'chaim\", & German \"Bach\", though it is usually said a little further back & a little stronger than those sounds. It is capitalized to remind us not to say it like the weak English \"h\".  When you see a lower-case \"h\" it will always be part of one of the consonants **ch**, **gh**, or **tlh**.\n\n**D** in Klingon sounds similar to the English \"d\", but said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth & is capitalized to help us remember the difference.\n\nnuqneH\n---\n**nuqneH** is a truncated form of **nuq DaneH**, meaning \"What do you want?\"\n\nIt is a common misconception that this is \"the Klingon word for hello\". In fact, Klingons have no word for hello. If a Klingon wishes to say something, they'll walk up to you and say it, without wasting time - as they see it - on idle chatter.\n\nThis phrase is a special exclamation and not a grammatically formed question.\n\nQapla'\n---\nKlingon for \"success\".\n\nThis word is often mistranslated as \"Goodbye\", due to the fact that it is often heard at the end of conversations. In fact, Klingon has no word for \"Goodbye\", but **Qapla'** is often used either to congratulate somebody on their success or to wish them success in the future.\n\nVerbs\n---\nIn grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one the action is done to.  Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of verbs by means of *prefixes*.\n\nIf the subject is third person (he/she/it/they) and has either no object or a third-person object (him/her/it/them), then the verb has no prefix. (With the exception of \"they - him/her/it\", which you will learn later). So a verb such as **yaj** can mean \"he understands; she understands; it understands; they understand; he understands him/her/it/them; she understands him/her/it/them; or they understand them\".\n\nBecause of the verbal prefixes, the subject and/or object does not have to be included as a pronoun, and subject or object pronouns are typically left off.\n\nJoining nouns with and without \"and\"\n---\nNouns are joined with **je**, which comes *after* the nouns, as in **torgh mara je** \"Torg and Mara\", or **Hol pong je** \"the language and the name\".\n\nIf there is no **je** after nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to possession: **mara pong** \"Mara's name\"; **tlhIngan Hol** \"a Klingon's language, the Klingon language\".\n\nWord order\n---\nKlingon word order in a sentence may seem like the opposite of English word order - first comes the object (if any), then the verb, then the subject. So a sentence such as **mara legh torgh** means \"Torg sees Mara\".\n\nComputer translations\n---\nYou may be tempted to use computer translators, like Bing. Just don't! The quality of Klingon machine translation is almost always very bad. Don't report sentences from there.","urlName":"Boot-Camp"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":37,"id":"fe8bda7710d2d42142188d121e979ee4","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Bravery","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Bravery","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit will teach you more of the sounds of Klingon. Don't worry if you can't say or hear them perfectly to begin with. Keep practising & you will get it.\n\nNote **I** (capital i) versus **l** (small L) - the second has a small curl at the bottom in Duolingo's website font. The vowel **I** never has an adjacent vowel. The consonant **l** will always have at least one adjacent vowel. \n\nPronunciation:\n---\nVowels each have one pronunciation.  \n**a** as in father  \n**e** as in ten  \n**o** as in bowl  \n**u** as the oo in pool  \n**I** as in it  \n\n**I** is uppercase to remind us that it is different from the pattern of 5 vowels we often see in foreign languages.\n\n**q** sounds much like an English \"k\", but from the back of the throat. The **q** does not include the \"w\" sound as in English words that begin with \"qu\". Even when **q** is followed by **u**, the two sounds do not blend. The Klingon word **qul** (\"fire\") sounds like the English word \"cool\", but with a stronger \"c\" sound. This is a different letter than **Q** explained later.\n\n**r** is not usually said at the roof of the mouth like an American English \"r\", but with the tip of the tongue behind the teeth like a Spanish \"r\".\n\n**S** is similarly said with the tip of the tongue further back in the high roof of the mouth. It winds up sounding a bit like an English \"sh\", but should never be said like an \"sh\".  The **S** is also capitalized to help us remember the difference.\n\nAdjectives\n---\nKlingon does not have adjectives as a separate class of words; instead, it has verbs which mean things such as \"be handsome\", \"be smart\", or \"be big\".\n\nA sentence such as **val torgh** \"Torg is smart\" has the same grammar (verb + subject) as **yaj torgh** \"Torg understands\", even though one sentence has an adjective in English and the other an active verb.\n\nNote that the English translation includes the connecting word \"is\" when you use an adjective, but the Klingon translation just connects the subject directly to the verb without using any sort of connecting word. As verbs, these Klingon words already contain the \"is\" in their definitions like \"be smart\".","urlName":"Bravery"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":31,"id":"190c1e7b9fb199709f037473f7a34ee4","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Quest","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Quest","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"**Q** & **q** are two separate letters. **ch gh ng** & **tlh** count as single consonants in Klingon. The **'** (apostrophe) also counts as a letter.\n\n**ch** is said as in \"church\". Never like an English \"k\" or \"sh\", & never like a German, Scottish, or Hebrew \"ch\".  Please note that **ch** is a single Klingon consonant.\n\n**j** should be said hard like the beginning & end of the English word \"judge\". Never with the softer sound from French.\n\n**w** & **y** are as in English at the beginnings of syllables. At the ends they form a combined sound called a diphthong. At the end of a syllable **w** sounds like \"oo\" & **y** sounds like \"ee\". So **paw** sounds like \"pow\" & **pay** sounds like \"pie\".\n\n**ng** is said exactly as in English, but English speakers are not used to it at the beginning of a word.  Put the rear of your tongue to the roof of your mouth to make this sound.  Please note that **ng** is a single Klingon consonant.\n\n**Q** combines the **q** sound & the **H** sound. It should start with the throat closed like you are going to make a **q**, but then explode into a raspy **H**-type sound.\n\n**'** marks a sound we do make in English. We don't usually mark it in English. In Klingon it is a full letter & leaving it out is like missing any other letter from a word. We call this **qaghwI'**. It is made by closing the throat & is called a glottal stop. It's the stop between syllables in the word \"uh-oh\". You may notice that you also close the throat at the beginning of \"uh-oh\" and all English words that start with a vowel. Klingon **'ej** sounds exactly like English \"edge\".\n\nApostrophes and quotes\n---\nAs noted above, Klingon uses the apostrophe **'** as a letter.\n\nIt does not use the double-quote character \" as a letter -- when you see what might look like a double-quote in the middle of the word, it is actually two apostrophes side by side.\n\nFor example, **maw'** means \"to be crazy\" or \"he/she is crazy\"; when you add the question suffix **-'a'**, you get **maw''a'?** \"is he/she crazy?\".\n\nVerbs\n---\nKlingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as **yaj** could mean \"understands, understood, will understand\".\n\nThey do have aspect (e.g. whether an action is completed or is continuous), but that will come later in the course. For now, translate verbs as non-continuous forms (e.g. \"he walks\" or \"he walked\" - not \"he is walking\" or \"he was walking\") until the continuous aspect is introduced.\n\nIn grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one the action is done to.  Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of verbs by means of *prefixes*.\n\nMeaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front or ends of words.  Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that action is done to.\n\nThe most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:\n\n- jI- = I (subject), no object\n- bI- = you (subject), no object -- for one person\n\nTime Stamps\n---\nSince Klingon verbs lack tense, a common way to indicate the tense of a sentence is to note the time frame of the action at the start of the sentence.  These are often called \"Time Stamps\".  We use them in English, too:  \n*Tomorrow I will fight the enemy.*\n\n\"Tomorrow\" is a time stamp.  In Klingon the word for \"tomorrow\" is **wa'leS**:  \n**wa'leS jagh vISuv.**\n\nIn English, time stamps can be moved around in the sentence and it is also possible to say, \"I will fight the enemy tomorrow.\"  This is NOT true in Klingon.  In Klingon the Time Stamp must be part of the beginning of the sentence and must be before the object, if there is one (which also means before the verb, whether there is an object or not).  As you learn more about Klingon grammar, you will see that there are also other elements that will be part of the beginning of the sentence before the object.","urlName":"Quest"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":46,"id":"ab35fbd43962e12be40d0aff7de317b3","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Celebrate","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Celebrate","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"**tlh** is another sound not made in English.

Please note that **gh** is a single Klingon consonant.\n\nVerbs\n---\nKlingon verbs do not have tense (past, present, future), so a verb such as **yaj** could mean \"understands, understood, will understand\".\n\nTime Stamps\n---\nYou will learn more time stamps, so let's review their use. \n Since Klingon verbs lack tense, a common way to indicate the tense of a sentence is to note the time frame of the action at the start of the sentence.  These are often called \"Time Stamps\".  We use them in English, too:  \nTomorrow I will fight the enemy.\n\n\"Tomorrow\" is a time stamp.

As you learn more about Klingon grammar, you will see that there are also other elements that will be part of the beginning of the sentence before the object.\n\nNew verb prefixes\n---\nNext to **jI-** for \"I ...\" and **bI-** for \"you ...\" (for one person), you will learn **Su-** for \"you ...\" (for multiple people, also some times said as \"you guys\", \"all of you\", \"you all\", or \"y'all\"). These prefixes indicate that there is no object.\n\nYou will sometimes be presented with an English sentence with the word \"you\" and no other indication whether this is supposed to be singular or plural.  In such cases, Duolingo will usually accept either the Klingon version for singular \"you\" or for plural \"you\".  But watch carefully for other grammar or context in the exercise that indicates whether the \"you\" might be singular or plural.\n\nPronouns\n---\nPronouns can represent a noun, but you must include the appropriate prefix : **maval maH** \"we are smart\"; **jIH cholegh SoH** \"you see me\".\n\nThe prefixes are required, the pronouns are not! Pronouns can be left off, since the verb prefix shows what the subject and object are.\n\nPronouns are commonly used to emphasise the subject and/or object, for example, **jIqet jIH 'ach bIyIt SoH** \"*I* am running but *you* are walking\".\n\nWhen the null prefix is used for third person subjects and objects, pronouns are sometimes used to clarify:  **mara legh qoq 'ej 'oH tI' ghaH** \"The robot sees Mara and she fixes it\".\n\nghaH vs 'oH\n---\nUnlike English, Klingon does not use separate pronouns for male or female: **ghaH** is used for all \"beings capable of using language\" (Klingons, humans, etc.) regardless of whether they are male or female. It can be translated as either \"he\" or \"she\" (or \"him\" or \"her\" as an object). To keep singular vs plural clear, we do not accept \"they\" as a translation, but we encourage the use of singular \"they\" in other contexts.\n\n**'oH** \"it\" is used for other things: animals, plants, inanimate objects, etc. Klingon is similar to English in that things are all \"it\" - there are no feminine forks or masculine chairs.\n\nThere may occasionally be nouns, such as an android, for which it is difficult to determine if it is a \"being capable of language\".  There is no correct answer for these and different people might use different pronouns.\n\nThis division into \"beings capable of using language\" and \"everything else\" is also used in forming plurals and in possessive endings, which will be taught later.","urlName":"Celebrate"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":23,"id":"aada8db22659be8c937e3399ed91ec42","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Prisoner","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Prisoner","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Negatives and questions\n---\nYou will come across some adjectivals and verbs that are negative -- he is not handsome, I am not stupid -- and/or are questions -- is he handsome? are you smart?.\n\nThese are formed with the verb suffix **-'a'** for a yes/no question and the verb suffix **-be'** for negative.  The verb suffix **-'a'** is classified as a \"type 9\" verb suffix and will always be the last suffix on a verb.  The verb suffix **-be'** is classified as a \"rover\", and the nature of its \"roving\" will be explained once you have learned more suffixes.\n\nThese suffixes can be added to any verb to turn it into a negative or a question. For example, **jIQong** \"I slept\", **jIQongbe'** \"I did not sleep\", **jIQong'a'?** \"did I sleep?\"; **bIval** \"you are smart\", **bIvalbe'** \"you are not smart\", **bIval'a'?** \"are you smart\"?\n\nEven negative questions are possible: **valbe''a' torgh?** \"Is Torg not smart?\", **yItbe''a' mara?** \"Didn't Mara walk?\" (Note that the **-'a'** is placed after the **-be'** since it always comes last on the verb.)\n\nPlease note that the **-'a'** verb suffix is not used when there is a question word such as \"who\", \"what\", \"where\", \"when\", \"why\", or \"how\".  It is only used to turn a statement into a yes/no question.  Question words will be covered later in this course, but you have already had a preview with questions like **nuq 'oH ponglIj'e'** (\"What is it your name?\").  Note that the suffix **-'a'** is not used because that is not a yes/no question and instead uses a question word.\n\nThe words HISlaH and ghobe'\n---\n**HISlaH** means \"yes\" and **ghobe'** means \"no\". These words are primarily used to answer yes/no questions. There are other words for refusal or acceptance, which English often uses \"yes\" and \"no\" for, but Klingon uses **Qo'** (which is used to express refusal, as in \"I won't!\") and **lu'** (which is used to express acceptance, as in \"I will!\").  Outside of this course, you may also see the word **HIja'** which also means \"yes\" and is a direct synonym to **HISlaH** with no different connotations.  This course will only show you the word **HISlaH** for \"yes\".\n\nNote that unlike the English word \"no\", the words **ghobe'** and **Qo'** cannot be used as determiners (as in \"We have no bananas.\"), nor as adverbs (\"I am no better.\"); they are strictly used as exclamations.  For those other meanings, Klingon requires you to negate the verb, instead, with the suffix **-be'**.\n\nApostrophes and quotes\n---\nRemember that Klingon uses the apostrophe ' as a letter.\n\nIt does not use the double-quote character \" as a letter -- when you see what might look like a double-quote in the middle of the word, it is actually two apostrophes side by side.\n\nFor example, **maw'** means \"to be crazy\" or \"he/she is crazy\"; when you add the question suffix **-'a'**, you get **maw''a'?** \"is he/she crazy?\".","urlName":"Prisoner"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":11,"id":"7c5c4ea283633642a09f83ae20f1f38e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Home","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Home","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Transitive verbs\n---\nThis lesson practises some transitive verbs (ones that have an object).\n\nRemember that the object comes **before** the verb and the subject goes **after** it in a Klingon sentence.\n\nThe lu- prefix\n----\nThe lesson introduces a new prefix: **lu-** is used when the subject is \"they\" and the object is \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\".\n\nRemember that if the subject is \"they\" and the object is \"them\" or there is no object, there is no prefix. Similarly if the subject is \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\" and the object is \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\".\n\nBut the combination \"they - him/her/it\" needs a prefix: **lu-**.\n\nNoun-Noun\n---\nIf there is no conjunction (like **je**) after nouns next to each other, the effect is similar to possession: **mara pong** \"Mara's name\"; **tlhIngan Hol** \"a Klingon's language, the Klingon language\".\n\nTo specify one person or thing that possesses another person or thing, the two nouns (or noun phrases) are simply presented next to each other with the first noun (or noun phrase) indicating the possessor and the second noun (or noun phrase) indicating the posession:  \n**HoD Duj** \"the captain's ship\"  \n**tlhIngan SoS** \"the mother of the Klingon\"\n\nPronouns\n---\nRemember that pronouns can represent a noun, but you must include the appropriate prefix : **maval maH** \"we are smart\"; **jIH cholegh SoH** \"you see me\".\n\nThe prefixes are required, the pronouns are not!

English sentences that use \"you\" are often ambiguous - they could be talking to one person or several - but Klingon sentences are clear.\n\nThere is no distinction for formality or politeness. You would address any one person, from the admiral of the fleet to your own younger sibling, as **SoH**.\n\nchaH vs bIH\n---\nRemember that **ghaH** is used for all \"beings capable of using language\" (Klingons, humans, etc.) and **'oH** \"it\" is used for other things: animals, plants, inanimate objects, etc.  Klingon makes the same distinctions in the plural. **chaH** is used for a group of beings capable of language and **bIH** for a group of things (inanimate objects, animals, etc.). A mixed group will most likely use **chaH bIH je**.","urlName":"Home"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"cce21176c3b81b5d84f7399b4b7fc5ea","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Basic sentences 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Basic","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"In grammar, a *subject* is the one doing the action and an *object* is the one the action is done to.  Klingon verbs show the *subject* and the *object* of verbs by means of *prefixes*.\n\nThe most important verb prefixes at the beginning of the course are:\n\n- jI- = I (subject), no object\n- bI- = you (subject), no object -- for one person\n- vI- = I (subject), him/her/it/them (object)\n- Da- = you (subject), him/her/it/them (object) -- for one person\n\nVerb and Noun suffixes\n---\nMeaning is added to Klingon words through use of syllables added to the front or ends of words.  Syllables added to the beginnings of words are called prefixes and in Klingon indicate who is doing a particular verb and who that action is done to.\n\nSuffixes are added to the ends of words and occasionally you will encounter a word with more than one suffix.  Klingon linguists categorize these suffixes according to which ones cannot occur together and what order they must occur in.  Verbs have 10 suffix types and generally only one suffix can occur from each type, but if you have one from each type, plus a prefix, you can have a very complicated verb!\n\nNouns have 5 suffix classes and you can only have one suffix of each type.  Klingon nouns can still get pretty complicated even with only 5 suffixes.\n\nThe types of the suffixes are numbered because they may only occur in the order of their numbers.  A type 1 suffix must always occur before a type 4 suffix.  This course will not be quizing you on the suffix types and it attempts to teach you the proper order through drilling and familiarity rather than through memorizing the types.  None the less, we will generally mention the suffix type in the Tips & Notes, in case you find it helpful or want to make a note of it.\n\nPlurals\n---\nEnglish plurals are a good example of using suffixes. In English an -s or an -es is generally added to the end of the noun to make it plural. Klingon plurals are formed in a similar fashion to the English method of forming plurals.  In Klingon a **-pu'**, **-Du'**, or **-mey** is added to the end of the noun.  These are the \"Type 2\" noun suffixes.\n\nNearly all Klingon nouns belong to one of three groups, depending on which \"Type 2\" noun suffix they use to form their plural:  \n- Beings capable of using language have a plural in **-pu'**  \n- Body parts have a plural in **-Du'**  \n- Everything else (including inanimate objects, robots, and animals) have a plural in **-mey**.\n\nThere are only a handful of exceptions where nouns have completely separate plurals, a bit like English \"person / people\".\n\nIn this lesson, you will come across some nouns that refer to beings capable of using language: \"man, woman, child\". These therefore form their plural in **-pu'**:\n\n| Singular (EN) | Singular (tlh) | Plural (EN) | Plural (tlh) |\n|---------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|\n| *woman* | **be'** | *women* | **be'pu'** |\n| *man* | **loD** | *men* | **loDpu'** |\n| *child* | **puq** | *children* | **puqpu'** |\n\nPlural suffixes in Klingon are optional and can be left off.  A noun without one of these suffixes might still be plural. In the following units, you may come across sentences where there is no plural suffix and only the nearby grammar tells you that a noun must be plural.\n\nJoining two sentences with \"and\"\n---\nIn the previous skills you learned that nouns are joined with **je** -- remember that it comes *after* the two nouns, as in **torgh mara je** \"Torg and Mara\".\n\nTo join two sentences with \"and\" a different word is used: **'ej**.  This word is placed *between* the sentences. For example, \"I run\" (**jIqet**) + \"I jump\" (**jISup**) can become \"I run and I jump\" (**jIqet 'ej jISup**).\n\n**'ej** is only for joining sentences or verb phrases together, not nouns -- you cannot say *torgh 'ej mara*, for example.","urlName":"Sentences-1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":24,"id":"0646df67f570af593cc120cb2a60e49d","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Dialogue I","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Dialogue","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Adjectives\n---\nKlingon does not have adjectives as a separate class of words; instead, it has verbs which mean things such as \"be handsome\", \"be smart\", or \"be big\".\n\nA sentence such as **val torgh** \"Torg is smart\" has the same grammar (verb + subject) as **yaj torgh** \"Torg understands\", even though one sentence has an adjective in English and the other an active verb.\n\nNote that the English translation includes the connecting word \"is\" when you use an adjective, but the Klingon translation just connects the subject directly to the verb without using any sort of connecting word. As verbs, these Klingon words already contain the \"is\" in their definitions like \"be smart\".\n\nIf, on the other hand, such a verb is used after a noun, it acts like an attributive adjective: for example, from **Duj** \"a ship\" and **tIn** \"big\", we can make **Duj tIn** \"a big ship\", and from **qach** \"a building\" and **'IH** \"beautiful\", we can make **qach 'IH** \"a beautiful building\".\n\nThis can't be interpreted as object + verb word order, because such verbs can't take an object -- they can't mean \"it bigs the ship\" or \"it beautifuls the building\".\n\nCompare again:  \n**tIn Duj** \"the ship is big\"  \n**Duj tIn** \"the big ship\"  \n**'IH qach** \"the building is beautiful\"  \n**qach 'IH** \"the beautiful building\"","urlName":"Dialogue-I"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"ad300b4498d9c879c8302495290082a3","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Simple sentences","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Sent. 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Suffixes -'egh and -chuq\n---\nThis lesson introduces the \"Type 1\" verb suffixes.\n\nThe suffixes taught here indicate that the subjects of the verb somehow affect themselves or each other.\n\n**-'egh** indicates that the subject of the verb affects itself (or the subjects affect themselves). For example, from **legh** (see), one could form **legh'egh torgh** \"Torg sees himself\" or **legh'egh puqpu'** \"the children see themselves\" (perhaps in a mirror).\n\n**-chuq** indicates that the subjects of the verb affect each other. It only makes sense if the subject is plural: \"we, you, they\". For example, **leghchuq puqpu'** would mean \"the children see each other\" -- that is, each child sees another child.\n\nIn more technical terms, the suffix -**'egh** makes a verb [*reflexive*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_verb), while the suffix -**chuq** makes it [*reciprocal*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal_%28grammar%29).\n\nPlurals\n---\nAs you have already seen, forming plurals is about as easy as in English -- where the basic rule is \"just add -s\". You may also remember that in Klingon, the plural ending depends on whether the noun is a being capable of language or a body part.\n\nBeings capable of language take **-pu'** (**tlhIngan** \"a Klingon\", **tlhInganpu'** \"Klingons\").\n\nBody parts take **-Du'** (and will be introduced later).\n\nEverything else takes **-mey** (**nagh** \"a rock\", **naghmey** \"rocks\").\n\nNote that Klingons do not generally consider robots (no matter how smart or independent) to qualify as \"beings capable of language\". Thus robots usually (and in this course, always) use the plural suffix **-mey**: one **qoq**, several **qoqmey**.\n\n(If you, the one taking this course, are a language-using robot, we apologize for any perceived slight this simplification may inflict.)\n\nPlural suffixes are optional in Klingon, so \"the Klingons\" could be translated as **tlhInganpu'** but also as **tlhIngan**.\n\nThe special case of **mang**\n---\nThe word **mang** \"soldier\" is introduced in this skill and as a being capable of language uses the plural **mangpu'**.  A note should be made that this is not the simple plural it appears to be.  There is a separate word, **negh** which is used to refer to a group of \"soldiers\" as a whole.  The plural word **mangpu'** has an implication that you are talking about each individual soldier in the group.  Thus **mangpu'** might be translated as \"each of the soldiers\".  For purposes of this lesson the simple plural \"soldiers\" will also be accepted.  \n\nSome more names\n---\nWhile you'll still see Torg (male) and Mara (female) in the course, this unit also introduces a few more names for variety.\n\nA few of these are female: **beylana, ghIrIlqa', luqara'** (B'Elanna, Grilka, Lukara)\n\nMost of them are male: **DuraS, ghawran, martaq, mogh, molor, moratlh, qeylIS, wo'rIv** (Duras, Gowron,  Martok, Mogh, Molor, Morath, Kahless, Worf).\n\nMore names will come later in the \"People\" skill.","urlName":"Simple-sentences"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":2,"id":"abf42a0234fce5828c5a19adc1ab9fff","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":6,"levels":6,"name":"Vocabulary 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Vocab. 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This lesson introduces some new verb prefixes and verb suffixes, as well as some more noun suffixes and the use of time stamps.\n\nVerb suffix -laH \"can\"\n---\nThe \"Type 5\" verb suffix **-laH** indicates \"can\" or \"able to\".\n\nFor example, it makes the difference between **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlh** \"I speak Klingon\" and **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaH** \"I can speak Klingon\".\n\nVerb suffix -be' \"not\"\n---\nIn an earlier unit we introduced the very useful verb suffix **-be'**, which means \"not\".  You may remember that this suffix is classified as a \"rover\".  Unlike suffix types 1-9, some of the rovers can actually be placed in different orders and change the meaning of the sentence slightly based on where they occur.\n\nThe \"rover\" suffix **-be'** comes after the verb portion which it negates.\n\nSo **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhlaHbe'** means \"I cannot speak Klingon\" (the **-be'** negates the **-laH**), while **tlhIngan Hol vIjatlhbe'laH** would mean \"I am able to not speak Klingon\" (the **-be'** negates the **vIjatlh** to make \"I do not speak\", and then **-laH** turns that into \"I can not-speak\" or \"I am able not to speak\").\n\nThe other feature of some of the rovers is that they can appear multiple times, thus negating multiple parts of the verb construction.  **jIjatlhbe'laHbe'** would mean, \"I cannot not speak,\" or, \"I am not able to not speak.\" (I know humans like that, but Klingons like that are much more rare.)\n\nMost verbs have only one or two suffixes at a time, and the correct order of suffixes will soon become second nature from seeing the most frequent combinations.\n\nNoun suffix -mey\n---\nThis unit more fully introduces the \"Type 2\" noun suffix **-mey**, which forms the plural of many nouns (the ones that are neither beings capable of language nor body parts).\n\nIn Klingon, plural suffixes are optional -- both **qach** and **qachmey** can be used for \"buildings\".\n\nSince it is clearer to use a plural suffix when there is more than one of something, these early units in the course usually use them even though they are optional. As you advance, sometimes we will show you sentences where only the verb prefix or other context indicates that a noun is plural.\n\nMore verb prefixes\n---\nYou've already come across what are probably the most common verb prefixes: **jI-**, **vI-**, **bI-**, **Da-**, **ma-**, **Su-**, and no prefix at all (sometimes called the \"null\" prefix).\n\nThis unit introduces some new verb prefixes for combinations of subjects and objects:\n\n| Prefix | subject | object |\n|-------|---------|--------|\n| **qa-** | I | you (singular) |\n| **Sa-** | I | you (plural) |\n| **cho-** | you (singular) | me |\n| **ju-** | you (singular) | us |\n| **pI-** | we | you (singular) |\n| **wI-** | we | him, her, it |\n| **DI-** | we | them |\n| **re-** | we | you (plural) |\n| **tu-** | you (plural) | me |\n| ** che-** | you (plural)  | us |\n| **bo-** | you (plural) | him, her, it, them |\n\nPay special attention to the fact that when the subject is \"we\", there are separate prefixes **wI-** and **DI-** depending on whether the third-person object is singular (him, her, it) or plural (them) -- unlike when the subject is \"I\" (**vI-** for both singular and plural third person subjects) or \"you (singular)\" (**Da-** for both singular and plural third person subjects) or \"you (plural)\" (**bo-**.for both singular and plural third person subjects). Though this is a constructed language, there are some irregularities like this that appear to make it resemble a natural language.\n\nSome of these prefixes are more frequent then others, especially the ones with an object of \"him, her, it\" and/or \"them\", so you'll see a fair bit of **bo-** in this course and some **wI-** and **DI-**, and it pays to get those three down.\n\nThe others are a bit rarer, though **cho-** and **qa-** (you do something to me, or I do something to you) are perhaps a bit more common than the others.","urlName":"Vocab-1"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":2,"id":"e5c749c7d413cd52646a96b5f6843b48","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Pronouns","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Pronouns","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Overview\n---\n| English | Klingon |\n|---|---|\n| I (am); me | jIH |\n| you (are); you | SoH |\n| he (is), she (is); him, her | ghaH |\n| it (is); it | 'oH |\n| we (are); us | maH |\n| you (are) - plural; you | tlhIH |\n| they (are) - language-users; them | chaH |\n| they (are) - things, etc.; them | bIH |\n\nTo be or not to be\n---\nKlingon does not have a verb \"to be\". Instead, pronouns help to fill that role.\n\n**jIH** means \"I\" or \"me\" but also means \"I am\" in sentences such as **tlhIngan jIH** \"I am a Klingon\".\n\n**ghaH** means \"he\", \"she\", \"him\", or \"her\" and also means \"he is\" or \"she is\" in sentences such as **tlhIngan ghaH** \"He is a Klingon\" or \"She is a Klingon\".\n\nTo specify who the \"he\", \"she\", or \"it\" is, Klingon uses pronouns in combination with a \"Type 5\" noun suffix **-'e'**. \"Torg is a Klingon\" is **tlhIngan ghaH torgh'e'**, and \"The men are Klingons\" is **tlhInganpu' chaH loDpu''e'**.\n\nThe \"Type 5\" noun suffix **-'e'** will be covered in more detail later. For now, please only use it where it is grammatically required -- this means only in sentences where a pronoun is used for \"to be\".\n\nUsing verbs adjectivally and \"to be\"\n---\nUsing a verb that can be used adjectivally for a statement, the verb includes \"to be\" in the verb - you do not use a pronoun as \"to be\" for this: **val jagh** (\"The enemy is smart\").  A pronoun may still be used to represent the subject - **val ghaH** \"she is smart\", but we consider \"is\" to be part of **val** rather than part of **ghaH**.\n\nWith a verb as an adjective following the noun it describes there is no \"to be\" in the English translation.  If you want to use such a noun phrase as the topic in a \"pronoun as to be\" sentence, the **-'e'** suffix goes on the end of the whole noun phrase (appearing to attach to the verb).\n\nCompare:\n\n- **val tlhIngan SuvwI'** \"The Klingon warrior is smart.\"\n- **val ghaH** \"She is smart.\"\n- **SuvwI' val** \"the smart warrior\"\n- **tlhIngan ghaH SuvwI' val'e'** \"The smart warrior is a Klingon.\"\n\nThis, that, these, those\n---\n\"This, these\" and \"that, those\" use \"Type 4\" noun suffixes: **-vam** and **-vetlh**, respectively: **Ha'DIbaHvam** \"this animal\", **Ha'DIbaHmeyvetlh** \"those animals\".\n\nWhether \"this\" or \"these\" is appropriate as a translation of **-vam** depends on whether the noun is singular or plural; similarly with \"that\" or \"those\" for **-vetlh**.\n\nThese type 4 suffixes come after the type 2 plural suffix and **-'e'** would come last as a type 5 suffix.\n\nChasing forest sarks\n---\nA **Sargh** \"sark\" is a Klingon riding animal.  The phrase, \"chasing forest sarks\" is an idiom for \"doing something complex and difficult\".","urlName":"Pronouns"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":1,"id":"5447bab7388424f6915c9401a890bf55","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Verb prefix practice","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Prefixes","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"## More prefixes ##\n\nThis lesson teaches and practises some more verb prefixes which combine subject and object:\n\n- **mu-**: indicates that the subject is *he, she, it, they* and the object is *me*\n- **Du-**: indicates that the subject is *he, she, it* and the object is *you* (one person)\n- **nI-**: indicates that the subject is *they* and the object is *you* (one person)\n- **nu-**: indicates that the subject is *he, she, it, they* and the object is *us*\n- **lI-**: indicates that the subject is *he, she, it, they* and the object is *you* (several people)\n\nFor example,\n\n- **mulegh tlhInganpu'** \"the Klingons see me\" (**legh** \"see\")\n- **mughov mara** \"Mara recognizes me\" (**ghov** \"recognize\")\n- **DuQoy torgh** \"Torg hears you\" (**Qoy** \"hear\")\n- **nISaH tera'nganpu'** \"Terrans care about you\" (**SaH** \"care about\")\n- **lISuj vay'** \"someone disturbs you all\" (**Suj** \"disturb\", **vay'** \"someone, something\")\n- **lIvoq be'pu'** \"the women trust you all\" (**voq** \"trust\")\n\nPay special attention to the fact that when the object is \"you (singular)\", there are separate prefixes **Du-** and **nI-** depending on whether the third-person subject is singular (he, she, it) or plural (they) -- unlike when the object is \"me\" (always **mu-**) or \"us\" (always **nu-**) or \"you (plural)\" (always **lI-**).

You have also learned how to use the **-be'** suffix, which is classified as a \"rover\" and can be placed in different locations to negate specific parts of the verb. This **-qu'** suffix is also a \"rover\" and can occur directly after the verb or after another suffix.  When it occurs directly after the verb it is used to emphasize the action or state of the verb itself.\n\nMost often, it's used on adjectival verbs to give a meaning like \"very ...\" or \"really ...\" or \"extremely ...\":  For example, **valqu' SuvwI'** could be translated as, \"The warrior is very smart,\" and, **yoHqu' SuvwI' valqu'** could be translated as \"The very smart warrior is really brave.\"\n\nNote that \"really\" is being used in these sentences to intensify the following word and not necessarily to imply the truthfulness of the statement (there are suffixes for that, but you'll learn them in another unit).\n\nWhen the suffix **-qu'** occurs after another verb suffix, it tends to emphasize the meaning of that specific suffix, though officially it is emphasizing the meaning of the whole word before it.  For instance:  \n**nIQoylaH** would mean, \"They can hear you,\"  \n**nIQoyqu'laH** would mean, \"They can really hear you,\"  \nand **nIQoylaHqu'** would mean, \"They are really able hear you.\"\n\nAs with **-be'**, the suffix **-qu'** can be used multiple times in the same verb construction (to emphasize multiple different things).  It is possible to say something like, **nIQoyqu'laHqu'** (\"They are really able to really hear you.\").\n\n### Demonstratives ###\n\nYou have already learned how to use the Noun Type 4 suffixes **-vam** (\"this\") and **-vetlh** (\"that\").  In English we use something called \"demonstrative adjectives\" to accomplish this same thing.  Similarly to how the Klingon suffixes attach to the ends of the nouns they are \"demonstrating\", these English \"demonstrative adjectives\" must be placed before the nouns that they are \"demonstrating\":  \n**tajvam** \"this knife\"  \n**tajvetlh** \"that knife\"\n\nEnglish also has something called \"demonstrative pronouns\" which can \"demonstrate\" a noun by taking the place of the noun and not attaching to anything:  \n\"This is a knife.\"  \n\"That is sharp.\"\n\nKlingon does not have anything like a \"demonstrative pronoun\".  There is no way to directly and literally translate such an English sentence.  We must come up with similar Klingon sentences that have the same sort of idea, even though they are not exactly the same.\n\nWe are not going to go through all the possible methods here.  We are just going to demonstrate one simple method.  While the Klingon pronoun **'oH** is a very close and direct translation of the English word \"it\", you can use it where an English speaker might use a \"demonstrative pronoun\".\n\nAn English speaker might hold out a knife in his hand and say, \"This is a knife.\"  A Klingon holding out the knife and wanting to demonstrate what it is would say, **taj 'oH.**  (Note that this sentence is using the pronoun **'oH** as if it were a verb meaning \"it is\" or \"this is\".)\n\nAn English speaker might point to the knife on the counter and say, \"That is sharp.\"  A Klingon pointing to the knife and wanting to demonstrate that it is sharp could say, **jej 'oH**.  (Note that **jej** is the verb \"to be sharp\" and **'oH** is just acting as a simple pronoun here.)\n\nOther third-person pronouns can be used in a similar method:  \n**tajmey bIH** (\"These are knives.\")  \n**tlhIngan ghaH** (\"That is a Klingon.\")  \n**Humanpu' chaH** (\"Those are Humans.\")\n\nYou will find some exercises in this unit which include English sentences that have \"demonstrative pronouns\".  We have included those sentences to give you a chance to practice using the regular Klingon third-person pronouns in place of the missing \"demonstrative pronouns\".","urlName":"Vocabulary-2"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":11,"id":"952a33fb5ecd29c04043e2b0cb7bee09","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":6,"levels":6,"name":"Locations and locatives","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Locations","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"In this unit, you will learn to speak about locations: being in a place or going to or from a place. You will also learn to specify a currently ongoing action.\n\n-Daq\n---\nThe \"Type 5\" noun suffix **-Daq** is a generic locative - depending on context, it can mean \"at, in, on, by, to\".  A noun with **-Daq** would normally come before the object of the sentence.\n\nDepending on the verb, you may not need **-Daq**; some verbs have destinations or locations \"built in\" to them and the destination or location is treated as an object.  Though in English we say that one would \"go to\" somewhere, Klingon does not use **-Daq** because the verb **jaH** already includes the idea of \"to\" when used with an object.\n\nThe word **nuqDaq** is usually translated as \"where\" and is placed into the same position that the location would go if it were a statement.  Even with verbs that have movement \"built in\" and would not normally have **-Daq** added to the destination, **nuqDaq** is used to ask \"where\".  Since this is a question word, the interrogative verb suffix **-'a'** is NOT used.\n\n-vo'\n---\nThe \"Type 5\" noun suffix **-vo'** means \"from\" and is used to specify a starting point or origin.\n\nAs both are \"Type 5\" noun suffixes, you may not use both **-Daq** and **-vo'** on the same noun. They can be used with other suffixes, such as plurals, **-vam**, or **-vetlh**.  When used with other suffixes, the \"Type 5\" noun suffixes always go last.\n\nWhen using **-Daq** or **-vo'** on a noun + adjectival verb, the \"Type 5\" suffixes (but not others) will go at the end of the entire phrase, appearing to attach to the verb: **loDpu' wochvo'** \"from the tall men\".\n\n-taH\n---\nThe \"Type 7\" verb suffix **-taH** is used for continuous or ongoing actions. Its meaning is very similar to that of the English -ing in \"I am running\".\n\nSince Klingon doesn't have tense, **jIqettaH** can mean \"I am running\" or can mean \"I was running\" or \"I will be running\" - the **-taH** only shows that it is, was, or will be an ongoing action.\n\n-lI'\n---\nThe \"Type 7\" verb suffix **-lI'** is similar to **-taH** and also identifies an ongoing action; however, it also implies that the action is heading towards a specific end or goal.\n\n**tera' vIjaHlI'** (with **jaH** \"go (to)\") could be translated as \"I am on my way to the Earth\" - with the suffix **-lI'** implying that the going is not only ongoing but that you are making progress towards a known end point (when you reach the Earth, you will stop).\n\nAs both are \"Type 7\" verb suffixes, you may not use **-taH** and **-lI'** on the same verb. They *can*, however, be used with other suffixe types.\n\nTo be in/at/on/by a place\n---\nAs noted before, pronouns help to fill the role of the verb \"to be\" in Klingon. This is also true with locations, such as, **monDaq 'oH** \"It is in the capital.\"\n\nAs with other \"to be\" sentences, if you want to explicitly state the subject when using a pronoun as the verb \"to be\", you have to use the noun suffix **-'e'**.  **yuQDaq 'oH veng'e'** \"The city is on the planet.\"\n\n-taH with pronouns\n---\nKlingon often uses **-taH** in combination with a pronoun and a location to indicate a temporary, but currently ongoing presence -- for example, **Qo'noSDaq ghaHtaH mara'e'** \"Mara is on Kronos\" (the Klingons' home world); a bit more literally, \"As for Mara, she is being on Kronos\".\n\nSum and Hop\n---\nThe adjectives **Sum** and **Hop** mean \"(be) near\" and \"(be) far\", respectively.\n\nOn their own, they usually mean that something is near the speaker or far from the speaker. For example, **Sum mara** would mean \"Mara is close (to me)\".\n\nIf you want to say that something or someone is close to (or far from) someone else, you can use **-Daq** to make the reference point explicit: **SoHDaq Sum mara** (literally, \"at you, Mara is close\") would mean \"Mara is near you\", while **SoHDaq Hop mara** (literally, \"at you, Mara is far\") would mean \"Mara is far away from you\".\n\nAbove and below\n---\nKlingon doesn't have prepositions such as \"above\" or \"below\" or \"next to\".\n\nInstead, there are nouns that mean \"area above\", \"area below\", \"area next to\", and so on, and things are described as being in (**-Daq**) those areas.\n\nThe area nouns that you will encounter in this lesson, together with a rough preposition equivalent in English, are:\n\n- **bIngDaq** \"in the area below\" = under\n- **DungDaq** \"in the area above or overhead\" = over\n- **jojDaq** \"in the area between\" = between, among\n- **retlhDaq** \"in the area beside or next to\" = next to\n- **tlhopDaq** \"in the area in front\" = in front of\n- **'emDaq** \"in the area behind\" = behind\n\n**nagh retlhDaq ghaHtaH torgh'e'** \"Torg is next to the rock\" literally means something like \"Torg is in the rock's area-beside\".\n\nNote that in standard Klingon, the way to say something like \"in front of me\" **jIH tlhopDaq** and \"behind you\" is  **SoH 'emDaq**. Later you will learn possessive suffixes (like \"my\" and \"your\"), but they are not used with these area nouns.","urlName":"Locations-and-locatives"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":27,"id":"3bc6c4839cfae1e98881e310b7d8feb1","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Aspect suffixes","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Aspect","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"## Aspect suffixes: revision and extension ##\n\nThis lesson gives some more practice and revision on the \"Type 7\" verbal aspect suffixes that you have met before (**-taH** and **-lI'**) and introduces two more: **-pu'** and **-ta'**.\n\nYou will then know all four of Klingon's \"Type 7\" verbal aspect suffixes.\n\nOf these four, **-taH** and **-pu'** are more general and so are more commonly used. **-lI'** and **-ta'** have more specific meanings and are only used when you want to emphasize those meanings.\n\n### -taH and -lI' ###\n\nAs you have seen before, these show continuous aspect - marking a given action as ongoing or continuous.\n\n**-lI'** specifically implies that action is headed towards some defined goal or end, while **-taH** is neutral in this respect. (It neither implies nor denies an endpoint, it just notes that the action is currently ongoing.)\n\nSometimes, \"is in the process of (doing something)\" may be an equivalent for **-lI'**. Sometimes, a different verb might convey the goal-oriented action, e.g. **tlha'taH** \"he is following him\" versus **tlha'lI'** \"he is pursuing him\".\n\n### -pu' and -ta' ###\n\nThese verb suffixes mark perfective aspect: that a given action is completed. They are commonly translated into the English perfect tenses: \"has done, had done, will have done\".\n\n**-pu'** is the more general and neutral suffix, and does not specify or deny any intent to have done the action.  The action may have been intentional, it may have been accidental, or it may have been beyond our control.\n\n(Don't confuse this one with the identical *noun* suffix **-pu'** that indicates the plural of beings capable of using language.)\n\nOn the other hand, the verb suffix **-ta'**, implies that the action was undertaken intentionally and was accomplished - that one set out to do the action and was successful in the action.\n\nSometimes the simplest way to represent **-ta'** in English is to add, \"has accomplished (doing something)\" or, \"has successfully (done something)\".  There are also some verbs which include a notion of intent in the verb and naturally lend themselves to using the **-ta'** suffix, like \"has defected\", \"has won\", or \"has executed\".  These verbs are not usually used when the action was not deliberately taken.\n\nNote that with **-taH**/**-lI'**, the difference was one of progressing towards an end point, but with **-pu'**/**-ta'** the end point has already been reached and the difference is instead a question of intent.\n\n##Adverbs: bong and chIch##\n\nThis unit introduces the adverbs **bong** \"accidentally\" and **chIch** \"intentionally\".\n\nAdverbs and adverbial expressions (such as expressions of time -- \"yesterday\", \"next month\", \"on Tuesday\" etc.) always come at the beginning in Klingon.\n\nNote that putting **chIch** at the beginning of the sentence or **-ta'** on the verb of the sentence creates a very similar meaning, but perhaps with a slightly different focus on intentionality vs. completion:  \n**chIch qoq vItI'pu'** \"I have intentionally fixed the robot.\"  \n**qoq vItI'ta'** \"I have accomplished fixing the robot.\"\n\nKlingon grammarians do not consider it incorrect to include both the adverb **chIch** and the suffix **-ta'** and do not consider it to be overly repetitive.  Such sentences are rare, but it is perfectly fine to say, **chIch qoq vItI'ta'** \"I have intentionally accomplished fixing the robot.\"\n\nA later unit (\"Adv\") will provide more adverbs for you to practice; this is a kind of preview.","urlName":"Aspect-suffixes"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":45,"id":"0f28e26006b8773a5e7068071354c44e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Imperatives","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Imperative","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"## Imperatives / Command forms ##\n\nHow to get people to do what you want them to? You ask them to nicely!\n\nKlingons are direct, so they don't waste time on words such as \"please\". That means that a command such as **yIngu''egh**! \"Identify yourself!\" is not necessarily considered rude; it could be the equivalent of \"Excuse me, could you tell me who you are, please?\".  A Klingon might consider such an uneccessarily complicated and roundabout question as rude and would see the directness of **yIngu''egh**! as much more polite.\n\n## yI- ##\n\nThe most important verbal prefix for imperatives is **yI-**.\n\nIt's used on all imperatives that have a grammatical object of \"him, her, it\", no matter how many people you are speaking to. It's also used on imperatives without a grammatical object if you are speaking to one person.\n\nFor example, **mara yISam!** \"Find Mara!\" could be directed to one person or to several, but **yI'Ij!** \"Listen!\" could only be addressed to one person.\n\n## pe- ##\n\nIf you wanted to issue a command without a grammatical object to several people, you would use the prefix **pe-** instead, e.g. **pe'Ij!** \"Listen!\".\n\nNote that the only time it matters how many people you are giving a command to is when there is no grammatical object.  For all commands with a grammatical object, the same prefix is used whether you are giving the command to one person or to many.  However, if there is no grammatical object, then you use **yI-** when giving the command to one person and **pe-** when giving the command to multiple people.\n\n## tI- ##\n\nThe prefix **tI-** is used whenever the object of the command is third person plural (\"them\"), e.g. **tera'nganpu' tIngu'!** \"Identify the Terrans!\". The same prefix is used whether you are speaking to one person or many of them.\n\n## HI-, gho- ##\n\n**HI-** is used when the object is \"me\" and **gho-** is used when the object is \"us\", e.g. **HIvoq!** \"Trust me!\" or **ghovuv!** \"Respect us!\". These are also the same regardless of whether you are speaking to one person or many.\n\n## -Qo' with imperatives ##\n\nWe have previously learned that statements are negated by using the negative verb suffix **-be'**.  However, for imperatives, a different suffix is used for negation. \n Negative imperatives use the suffix **-Qo'**. For example, **HIHot!** \"Touch me!\" can be turned into **HIHotQo'!** \"Don't touch me!\"\n\nThe **-Qo'** suffix is officially grouped with the rover verb suffixs, but it doesn't actually rove at all.  Even if there are more than one suffix on the imperative verb, the **-Qo'** suffix will occur last.\n\nThere are some circumstances where specific suffixes would follow the **-Qo'** suffix, but they do not occur with imperatives.  You will learn about those later in the course.  For now, if you are negating a command, place the **-Qo'** suffix at the end of the verb, after any other suffixes.\n\n## wej ##\n\nThe adverb **wej** appears at the beginning of the sentence and makes the sentence a negative sentence meaning, \"not yet\".  It is not used with negative suffixes like, **-be'** and **-Qo'** and can be used with statements, questions, and commands.  For instance:  \n**wej jagh wISuvpu'.** \"We have not yet fought the enemy.\"  \n**wej paq DalaD'a'?** \"Didn't you read the book yet?\"  \n**wej qoq yItI'!** \"Don't fix the robot yet!\"\n\n## state verbs (\"adjectivals\") ##\n\nWhen you form the command form of a verb that describes a state, rather than an action (the kind of Klingon verb that in English would often be an adjective, such as **yoH** \"be brave\" or **matlh** \"be loyal), you need the suffixes **-'egh** and **-moH**, e.g. **yIyoH'eghmoH!** \"be brave!\", literally \"make yourself brave!\", or **pematlh'eghmoH!** \"be loyal!\", literally \"make yourselves loyal!\".\n\nThe suffix **-moH** is taught later on, so you will not see such commands with state verbs in this unit. This is just a grammar preview.","urlName":"Imperatives"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":43,"id":"89a5dce41c858727966a905e155dad62","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Volition / Predisposition","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Volition","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This lesson introduces the \"type 2\" verb suffixes, which indicate things such as how much choice the subject has in performing the action of the verb or their willingness or readiness to do so.\n\n-nIS\n---\n**-nIS** means \"need\"; sometimes \"must\" or \"have to\" can also be appropriate. **maqetnIS** \"we need to run (we must run, we have to run)\"\n\n-qang\n---\n**-qang** means \"willing\" and indicates that the subject of the verb does not mind taking a certain action under the circumstances and does so willingly: **tera' vIjaHqang** \"I am willing to go to Earth\".\n\n-vIp\n---\n**-vIp** means \"afraid\" and shows that the subject is afraid to do the given action: **tlhIngan Soj SopvIp tera'ngan** \"the earthling is afraid to eat the Klingon food\" (**Soj** \"food\", **Sop** \"eat\").\n\nYou will rarely hear the **-vIp** suffix from a Klingon with a prefix indicating that the subject is \"I\" or \"we\" -- it's a cultural taboo to indicate that the speaker (or a group including the speaker) is afraid to do something.\n\n-beH\n---\n**-beH** means \"ready\" or \"set up\" and shows that the device acting as the grammatical subject is in a state where it can perform the required action: **labbeH** \"it is ready to transmit (data)\" (**lab** \"transmit data\")\n\n-rup\n---\n**-rup** is similar to **-beH**, but is used with sentient subjects (this time, no language use is necessary, so animals, for example, qualify); it means \"ready\" or \"prepared\" and is used when the subject (a sentient being) is able to take on a task because they are ready to do so: **qaleghrup** \"I am ready to see you\".\n\nOrder of suffixes\n---\nWith all of these suffixes, remember that the negative suffix **-be'** follows the part of the word that is negated -- this means that it's important to look at the order of suffixes in a word.\n\n**laDvIpbe'** has **-be'** after **-vIp** and so means \"he is not afraid to read it\" (he is **-vIpbe'** to **laD**), while **laDbe'vIp** has **-be'** after **laD** and so means \"he is afraid to not read it; he is afraid not to read it\" (he is **-vIp** to **laDbe'**).\n\nOr as another example, **Duj wItI'nISbe'** has **-be'** after **-nIS** and so means \"we do not need to repair the ship; we do not have to repair the ship\" while **Duj wItI'be'nIS** has **-be'** after **tI'** and so means \"we must not repair the ship; we need to not repair the ship\".\n\nNote that only one \"type 2\" verb suffix can be placed on a single verb.  It is impossible to use \"type 2\" verb suffixes alone to indicate that someone is \"willing to be afraid to do something\" or \"willing to be ready to do something\".  For these kinds of meanings much more complicated constructions, probably consisting of multiple sentences, will need to be used.\n\nwo'vaD\n---\nIn this unit, you will encounter the word **wo'vaD**.  The **-vaD** suffix will be explained in detail in a later unit, but for now, note that this word is not used as the object or subject of a verb, but is instead placed before the OVS structure to indicate that the action is done on behalf of the Empire.","urlName":"Volition-_-Predisposition"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":48,"id":"5fd9688270e661f86e3cd44ed567cfcb","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"if ... then","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"If-Then","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"To express the concept \"if\", Klingons attach a \"type 9\" verb suffix on the end of the verb: **-chugh**.\n\nFor example, from **bIyIt** \"you walk\", you can make **bIyItchugh** \"if you walk\".\n\nAs in English, the \"if\" clause can come before or after the \"result\" clause:\n\n- **bIDoy'chugh yIQong** \"If you are tired, sleep!\"\n- **yIQong bIDoy'chugh** \"Sleep, if you are tired!\"\n\nBecause of this, the exercises will often be strict in requiring that you maintain the order of the clauses. When the \"if\" clause comes first in the language presented to you, it must also come first in the translation.  Similarly, if the \"result\" clause comes first in the language presented to you, it must also come first in the translation.\n\nThe result clause may start with **vaj** \"then, so, thus, in that case\", especially when the \"if\" clause comes first: e.g. **bIDoy'chugh vaj yIQong** \"If you are tired, then sleep!\" It is more unusual, but not incorrect to see **vaj** on the result clause when it comes first: **vaj yIQong bIDoy'chugh** \"Then sleep, if you are tired!\"  It is also common to see the two clauses side by side without using **vaj** in the result clause.\n\nThis unit teaches \"if\" sentences with conditions that are considered real or possible.

Those Endings are taught later, in the \"Family 1\" unit.\n\nSince you have now learned many of the possessive suffixes, remember that the possessive suffixes are not generally used with area nouns.  In **ta' Hol** we don't say ***tlhopwIjDaq*** or ***'emlIjDaq*** (though speakers from Sakrej region would) - instead **ta' Hol** speakers would use pronouns and say, **jIH tlhopDaq** (\"in front of me\") and **SoH 'emDaq** (\"behind you\").\n\n### Preview of -bogh ###\n\nYou will see the **-bogh** relative-clause verb suffix used in this Skill.

You have already seen some examples such as **tlhIngan** (\"Klingon\"), **tera'ngan** (\"Terran\"), **be'** (\"woman\") and **loD** (\"man\").\n\nYou will also be reviewing the \"type 2\" plural noun suffix **-pu'**\n\nYou may remember that **-pu'** is a noun suffix that pluralizes nouns describing *beings capable of using language*. Including Klingons, Humans, Organians, Vulcans, men and women, warriors and teachers, emperors and chancellors, potentially even sentient robots (but not in this course).\n\nOther plurals which you have already seen are:\n\n* **Body parts**\nIncluding hands and feet, arms and legs, bones and kidneys. The plural suffix for this category is **-Du'**.\n\n* **Everything else**\nIncluding rocks and trees, plants and animals, shoes and starships, beams and waves. The plural suffix for this category is **-mey**.\n\nIn this skill, we'll be focusing on just the first of these suffixes, **-pu'**. The others are practiced in other units of the course.\n\nWhile the plural suffixes can make a sentence more clear, they are in fact completely optional. The word **tlhIngan** can mean either \"Klingon\" or \"Klingons\", whereas the word **tlhInganpu'** is explicitly plural and can only mean \"Klingons\".\n\nSo, if you're asked to translate the sentence \"I see Klingons.\", you can respond with either:\n\n* **tlhInganpu' vIlegh.** (\"I see Klingons.\")  \nor  \n* **tlhIngan vIlegh.** (\"I see one or more Klingons.\")\n\nYou can also sometimes distinguishing between singular and plural nouns based on the use of the verb prefixes:\n\n- **SuvwI' lulegh tera'ngan.** \"The Terrans saw the warrior.\" (The subject must be plural and the object must be singular because the **lu-** prefix must have a plural subject and singular object.)\n- **torgh legh HoD.** \"The captain saw Torg.\" (Assuming there is only one Torg, the subject must be singular, otherwise the **lu-** suffix would have been used.)\n- **nov legh yaSpu'.** \"The officers saw the aliens.\" (Since the subject is plural, the object must be plural, otherwise the **lu-** suffix would have been used.)\n- **Dulegh tlhIngan.** \"The Klingon saw you.\" (The subject must be singular because the **Du-** prefix must have a singular subject.)\n- **nIlegh loD.** \"The men saw you.\" (The subject must be plural because the **nI-** prefix must have a plural subject.)\n- **be' wIlegh.** \"We saw the woman.\" (The object must be singular because the **wI-** prefix must have a singular object.)\n- **Human DIlegh.** \"We saw the humans.\" (The object must be plural because the **DI-** prefix must have a plural object.)\n\n**quv** vs. **batlh**\n---\nBoth of the *nouns* **quv** and **batlh** are usually represented by the same English word \"honor\".  In English we use the word \"honor\" for a few different purposes, but Klingon distinguishes the personal accounting of \"honor\" that one earns and separates it from the \"honor\" which we talk about as an internal, philosophical concept of doing the right thing.  As nouns, the official descriptions state that **quv** is \"associated with reputation, dignity, and respect\" and **batlh** is \"associated with integrity, rectitude, scruples, and principles\".\n\nThus **quv** as a *verb* is usually translated as \"be honored\" and **batlh** as an *adverb* is usually translated as \"honorably\" or \"with honor\".  **quv** cannot be used as an adverb and **batlh** cannot be used as a verb.\n\nMore Klingon names\n---\nStarting from this lesson, you may also meet the following additional Klingons:\n\nFemale names -- **'a'Setbur, be'etor, lurSa', boqor, lurveng** (Azetbur, B'Etor, Lursa, Bokor, Lurveng)\n\nMale names -- **cheng, DuraS, ghorqon, qarghan, qImpeq, toral, turghal, tlha'a** (Chang, Duras, Gorkon, Kargan, K'Mpec, Toral, Turgal, Klaa)\n\nMiscellaneous names -- **ghurlaq** (Gurlak)\n\nAnd a few non-Klingons: **qIrq** (Kirk, male); **pIqarD** (Picard, male); **'elvIS** (Elvis, male).\n\nCaptain Torg\n---\nTitles come after the name in Klingon, the opposite order to English. So, \"Captain Torg\" becomes **torgh HoD**.  Rarely this can cause confusion as the same phrase can also mean \"Torg's captain.\"\n\nra'wI' - \"commanding officer\"\n---\nThe noun **ra'wI'** is actually made of a verb + suffix combination and you will learn how to create such words later in this course. This is defined as \"one who commands\" or \"commander\", though we must be careful not to confuse this with the similar rank.  Thus it is translated as \"commanding officer\" in this course.  Note that a **ra'wI'** does not have to be an officer and this is just being used to differentiate from the rank. As a noun, **ra'wI'** can take all the noun suffixes including the posessive suffix **-wI'**. At first the word **ra'wI'wI'** (\"my commanding officer\") may seem odd, but you will get used to it.","urlName":"People"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":10,"id":"8dc95bba17c2612bcd0ab034de4fbffa","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Body Parts 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Body Parts","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Body parts (eyes, hands, etc.) have a special plural in Klingon: they are pluralised not with **-mey** or **-pu'** but with **-Du'**, e.g. **mInDu'** \"eyes\", **nItlhDu'** \"fingers\".\n\nAs always, the plural suffix is optional.\n\nExcept for the separate plural ending, they act grammatically like other inanimate objects, e.g. using **'oH** and **bIH** (\"it, them\") rather than **ghaH** and **chaH** (\"he/she, them\") and using the regular possessive endings (ending in **j**) such as **-wIj** \"my\".\n\nCultural note: Klingons have built-in redundancy in their internal organs so that if, for example, one liver should fail due to injury or disease, the other one can keep on working.  This means that many body parts for which humans have only one, Klingons have in pairs.\n\nKlingons also possess a body part that is not spoken about in polite company: the **qIvon**, about which little is known among other races besides its name and the fact that some (or perhaps all) Klingons seem to have more than one.  The **qIvon** is featured in some common Klingon phrases, but don't expect to ever get a Klingon to show you, or even tell you about, his **qIvonDu'** unless you get to know him extremely well.\n\nThe saying **bIrchugh qIvon tuj 'Iw** literally translates as, \"If the qIvon is cold, the blood is hot,\" but seems to mean something like, \"Even when a Klingon does not seem so, he is always ready for battle.\"\n\nThe idiom **bel qIvon** is often used with kids and seems to refer to going to the bathroom.  One might ask a kid, **belHa''a' qIvonlIj**? (\"Is your qIvon displeased?\") or excuse themselves from the room with **qIvonwIj vIbelnISmoH** (\"I must please my qIvon.\").","urlName":"Body-parts"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":2,"id":"110faaa8cbdff4601bdfc8be03748ac3","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Adjectives","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Adjectives","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit teaches you some more verbs which can be used adjectivally.  Remember that, though these are adjectives in English, there is no such thing as an adjective in Klingon and these are really verbs which can be used in a manner resembling an adjective.\n\nThese verbs can be used both in a manner similar to an attributive adjective describing a noun (in which case they come after the noun) or as a predicate adjective (like \"... is blue/old/brave/...\") in which case they are normal verbs and come before the subject without any connecting words (unlike English which uses the connecting verb *is/are/be*).\n\n### old, new, and young ###\n\nA pair of adjectives to pay special attention to is **ngo'** and **qan**, as these both translate to \"old\" in English.\n\n**ngo'** \"old\" is the opposite of **chu'** \"new\", while **qan** \"old\" is the opposite of **Qup** \"young\".\n\nSo a book or a house can be **ngo'** but a person will be **qan**.\n\n### colors ###\n\nKlingon has very few basic color names, so each color covers quite a broad part of the spectrum of visible light.\n\nMost straightforward are **chIS** \"white\" and **qIj** \"black\".\n\n**Doq** covers colors in the red-orange-brown part of the spectrum.  It might be helpful to think of **Doq** as meaning \"warm colored\", though for translating purposes we ask you to pick a specific color in the range. \n\n**SuD** covers colors in the yellow-green-blue part of the spectrum.  It might be helpful to think of **SuD** as meaning \"cool colored\", though for translating purposes, we, again, ask you to pick a specific color in the range.\n\nThere isn't really a word for \"purple\" or \"violet\" in Klingon, perhaps because Klingon eyes can't perceive that color, though this is a controversial assertion. Some non-Klingons use **Doq 'ej SuD** \"blue and red\".\n\nFurther color distinctions can be made either with additional adjectives such as **wov** \"light\" and **Hurgh** \"dark\"; with the suffix **-qu'** \"very, really\"; or by using similes. (For example, brown things are sometimes describes as **Qaj wuS rur** \"resembles kradge lips\", in reference to the kradge, an animal with -- you guessed it -- brown lips.)\n\n### Placement of adjectives and suffixes ###\n\nRemember that, in Klingon, verbs acting adjectivally to modify nouns come after the nouns they modify, as in **tlhIngan woch** \"a tall Klingon\". In contrast, when a noun is used to modify another noun, it comes before the noun it is modifying, as in **tlhIngan Hol** \"the Klingon language\".\n\nWhen using a noun phrase made up of two nouns as a location or as the topic of a \"pronoun as to be\" sentence, the suffixes **-Daq** (\"in/at/on/by/to\"), **-vo'** (\"from\"), or **-'e'** (topic) go at the end of the phrase, which is the main noun: **tlhIngan DujmeyDaq jIQuch** \"I am happy on Klingon ships\".\n\nWhen using a noun phrase that is made up of a noun + adjectival verb as a location or topic, such suffixes still go at the end of the phrase, which makes them appear to attach to the verb: **Dujmey chu'Daq jIQuch** \"I am happy on new ships.\"\n\nCompare those two sentences to make sure you see the difference between using a noun to modify another noun and using a verb to modify a noun:  \n**tlhIngan DujmeyDaq jIQuch** \"I am happy on Klingon ships\".  \n**Dujmey chu'Daq jIQuch** \"I am happy on new ships.\"\n\nWhen using both kinds of modifiers, these type 5 noun suffixes will still go at the end of the whole phrase, again appearing to attach to the verb: **tlhIngan Dujmey chu'Daq jIQuch** \"I am happy on new Klingon ships.\"","urlName":"Adjectives"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":18,"id":"f07350db50541f9cbd010d5fac36833b","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Adverbials","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Adv","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit covers a range of adverbial words in Klingon.

Ordinal numbers come after the noun they are indicating: **Duj wa'maHDIch** \"the tenth ship\".\n\nTo count the number of repetitions of something, you can add the suffix **-logh** to a number: **wa'logh** \"once\", **cha'logh** \"twice\", **javvatlhlogh** \"six hundred times\".  Repetitions act like adverbs and come at the front of the sentence (i.e. before the OVS).\n\n#The question word 'ar\n\nThe word **'ar** means \"how many?\" or \"how much?\". This word follows the singular form of the word that it is inquiring about. For example:\n\n* **nagh 'ar Daje'?** - *\"How many rocks did you buy?\"*\n\n*  **nIm 'ar Daje'?** - *\"How much milk did you buy?\"*\n\nIf the noun that **'ar** is referring to can take a Type 2 plural suffix, the plural suffix should NOT be used, but the word should still be treated as plural:  \n**Duj 'ar DIghaj?** - *\"How many ships do we have?\"*\n\nIf the noun that **'ar** is referring to does not normally take a Type 2 plural suffix, for instance mass nouns and inherently plural nouns, then the word should be treated as singular:  \n**bIQ 'ar wIghaj?** - *\"How much water do we\n have?\"*\n\nRemember that we do not use the interrogative verb suffix **-'a'** with question words such as **'ar**.  The interrogative verb suffix **-'a'** is only used to form a yes/no question from a statement.\n\n#law' & puS\n\nIn this unit you will also learn the words **law'** \"be many\" and **puS** \"be few\".  These are verbs and not actually numbers.  They can be used as verbs to make complete sentences:  \n**law' tlhIngan Duj** \"The Klingon ships are many.\" (or in English we might be more likely to say it as, \"There are many Klingon ships.\").  \n**puS verengan yoH** \"The brave Ferengi are few.\" (or in English we might be more likely to say it as, \"There are few brave Ferengi.\")\n\nThese verbs can also be used in an adjectival manner by following a noun:  \n**pawtaH tlhIngan Duj law'** \"Many Klingon ships are arriving.\"  \n**yoH verengan puS** \"A few Ferengi are brave.\" (or in English we might be more likely to say it as, \"There are a few brave Ferengi.\")","urlName":"Numbers-0-100"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":29,"id":"dfa399ebf5ee2b2473d9fa0d6c8020f5","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Family 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Family 1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces possessive suffixes for beings capable of speech -- for example, \"my father, your sister, her brother\" etc. -- as well as Klingon kinship terms, i.e. names for various relatives.\n\n## Possessive suffixes for beings capable of speech ##\n- **-wI'** \"my\"\n- **-lI'** \"your\" (belonging to one person)\n- **-Daj** \"his, her, its\"\n- **-ma'** \"our\"\n- **-ra'** \"your\" (belonging to several people)\n- **-chaj** \"their\"\n\nNotice that, **-Daj, -chaj** \"his, her, their\" are the same as for things not capable of speech - the others differ by ending in **j** for inanimate objects but in **'** for beings capable of speech.\n\nDo not mix them up in the company of Klingons and refer, for example, to **puqlIj** \"your child\" as if it were an object.\n\nNote that these suffixes are not used when you are explicitly indicating the possessor with a name or a noun.  For instance, \"the captain's mother\" would be **HoD SoS**.  The suffixes are only used to refer to the possessor with generic pronouns, like English \"your\", \"his\", \"their\", etc. So \"his mother\" would be **SoSDaj**.\n\n## Kinship terms ##\nThe Klingon kinship term system is quite a bit more specific than in English, which often merges similar relatives together (e.g. \"cousin\" can refer to any grandchild of any of your grandparents that is not your brother or sister, and an \"uncle\" can be related to you by blood or by marriage). On the other hand, Klingon makes no distinction between cousins and nephews/nieces, unlike English.\n\n### Terms for lineal relatives ###\nNames for lineal relatives (direct ancestors or descendants) map pretty neatly to English, since English has separate words for pretty much all of these:\n\n- **vavnI', SoSnI'** \"grandfather, grandmother\"\n- **vav, SoS** \"father, mother\"\n- **loDnal, be'nal** \"husband, wife\"\n- **loDnI', be'nI'** \"brother, sister\"\n- **puq; puqloD, puqbe'** \"child; son, daughter\"\n- **puqnI'; puqnI'loD, puqnI'be'** \"grandchild; grandson, granddaughter\"\n\nThis unit also includes the form **vavoy** \"daddy\", which is an affectionate term, usually for one's own daddy. The suffix -oy in that word will be introduced properly and used more widely in the unit \"Grandeur\" later on.\n\n### Terms for collateral relatives ###\nNames for aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, and nieces are more specific than in English -- speakers of languages such as Chinese, Swedish, or Turkish may be more at home here (though Klingon makes no distinction between elder and younger siblings).\n\n#### Parents' generation, father's side (paternal uncles and aunts) ####\nYour father's brother is your **tennuS** and his wife is your **'e'mamnal**.\n\nYour father's sister is your **'e'mam** and her husband is your **tennuSnal**.\n\n#### Parents' generation, mother's side (maternal uncles and aunts) ####\nYour mother's brother is your **'IrneH** and his wife is your **me'nal**.\n\nYour mother's sister is your **me'** and her husband is your **'IrneHnal**.\n\n#### Your and your children's generations (cousins, nephews, and nieces) ####\nYour cousins are divided into parallel cousins (children of father's brother/mother's sister, i.e. of the sibling of the same gender as your parent) and cross cousins (children of father's sister/mother's brother).\n\nYour parallel cousins are your **tey'pu'**; they are **tey'loD** if male and **tey'be'** if female. Your cross cousins are your **lorpu'**; they are **lorloD** if male and **lorbe'** if female. Klingons tend to be closer to their parallel cousins than to their cross cousins.\n\nThese same names are also used for your nephews and nieces -- parallel nephews and nieces (if you're a man, then your brother's children; if you're a woman, then your sister's children) are **tey'pu'** as well, while children of your sibling of the opposite gender as you are your **lorpu'**.\n\nGroups of **tey'pu'** and **lorpu'** together are your **vInpu'** \"cousins (in general) and nephews and nieces (in general)\"; one of them may also be called a **vIn** \"cousin, nephew, or niece\".\n\nMore distant cousins (second cousin once removed, grandnephew, etc.) are **yurpu'**.\n\n#### More general terms ####\nAn **'e'nal** is an in-law in general: someone who married into your family, whether father-in-law, sister-in-law, uncle-in-law or whatever.\n\nA **tuqnIgh** is a member of your **tuq** \"house\", i.e. your extended family unit or clan.\n\nFinally, there are three verbs for \"to marry\": what a man does is **Saw** while what a woman does is **nay**.  These specific verbs are usually preferred, but if the situation does not allow you to be specific you can say **tlhogh**, which can be used by either partner for \"to marry\".\n\n##quvmoH - to honor##\nYou have previously seen **quv** (\"to be honored\"), but one can also honor another with **quvmoH**.  The **-moH** ending is a suffix that you will learn later in the course.

Klingon does have a word which can refer to a specifc, individual solitary sock: **tu'mI'**.  It would be very unusual to use the word **tu'mI'** with a Type 2 plural noun suffix and **paSlogh** would usually be used when refering to more than one sock.

The **-'a'** verb suffix is only used to turn a statement into a yes/no question and is not used with question words, like these.\n\nThis unit also introduces the question tag **qar'a'?**. This literally means, \"is it accurate?\", but it can also act as a general question tag -- English translations might include \"doesn't he? aren't we? isn't that so? eh? innit? right?\" depending on the sentence it is attached to, the level of formality, and where you come from.\n\nA few notes on the question pronouns **nuq** and **'Iv**:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nJust as the difference between **ghaH** and **'oH**, **'Iv** is used for all \"beings capable of using language\" (Klingons, humans, etc.) and can be translated as \"who\" or \"whom\" and **nuq** \"what\" is used for other things: animals, plants, inanimate objects, etc.\n\nAs pronouns, they can act like a noun and they would be placed in the same position as the answer would occur in the sentence:  \n**Sop 'Iv?** \"Who ate it?\"  \n**nuq Sop?** \"What did he eat?\"\n\n Also like pronouns, they can act like a verb to form a \"to be\" question (the same way that **'oH**, **ghaH**, etc. form \"to be\" sentences).\n\nSo you may see sentences like **'Iv ghaH tlhInganvetlh'e'?** \"Who is that Klingon?\" or **nuq 'oH ponglIj'e'?** \"What is your name\" with **'Iv** and **nuq** acting like nouns, and you may also see sentences like **tlhInganvetlh 'Iv?** or **ponglIj nuq?** with **'Iv** and **nuq** acting like verbs.","urlName":"Question-words"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":40,"id":"3ac073e2868633df2593f07f3ec99eee","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Beneficiaries","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"to/for","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces the noun suffix **-vaD**.\n\nIt indicates the beneficiary of an action (for whom something is done?) and is often translated as \"for\" or \"to\". Note that \"beneficiary\" is a linguistic term and the action is not always to the benefit of the beneficiary.  If you give a bomb to someone, they are the beneficiary, even though the bomb does not necessarily benefit them.\n\nNote that the word \"action\" is used a couple times in the above paragraph.  This suffix connects a noun to a verb when that noun is neither the subject nor the direct object.  An example of it's use is that the recipient of verbs of speaking or giving would be marked as the beneficiary.\n\nAnother example would be its use with **pong** \"to name, to call\" to mark the beneficiary -- the person or thing given a certain name -- e.g. **SoHvaD mara vIpong** \"I will call you Mara\" (in the sense of: I will use the name Mara for you). The English translation does not appear to use a preposition, but Klingon does use **-vaD** to indicate the \"beneficiary\" or \"recipient\" of the naming.\n\n## Placement of **-vaD**\n\nA noun marked with **-vaD** cannot be used as an object or subject and will occur before the OVS structure of the sentence.  Since this suffix marks the syntactic role of the noun or noun phrase, like **-Daq**, **-vo'**, and **-'e'**, you may not combine any of these suffixes together and you can only choose one syntactic role for the noun or noun phrase.\n\nYou can, however, combine the syntactic markers with other suffixes like plurals and possessives.  If a noun has multiple suffixes, **-vaD** will always be the last.  \n\nIf **-vaD** (like the other syntactic markers) is placed on a noun phrase created using noun + adjectival verb, this suffix moves to the end of the phrase, thus appearing to attach to the verb: **jupwI' QIpvaD paq vInob** \"I will give the book to my stupid friend.\"\n\n## The prefix trick\n\nIn English, we can say either \"I gave the book to him\" or the shorter \"I gave him the book\", without \"to\"; the sentences mean the same thing and the word order makes it clear what is meant.\n\nKlingon also allows one to abbreviate sentences that would use **-vaD** in some cases. The recipient has to be first or second person (to me, to you, to us) and there must either be a third-person direct object (a singular or plural noun or one of the pronouns \"him, her, it, them\"), or there is no object stated and the verb cannot take a person as a direct object.\n\nTo abbreviate a sentence like this, the verb prefix will show the subject as usual, but will show the *indirect* object (the beneficiary/recipient) rather than the *direct* object.\n\nFor example, **cho-** is the verb prefix for \"subject = you (one person), object = me\". If we say **paq chonob**, it will mean \"you gave me a book\": the same thing as **jIHvaD paq Danob** \"you gave a book to me\".\n\nIn the shorter version, **paq chonob**, it is clear that \"me\" is not the direct object (the thing given) because an explicit object **paq** is present.\n\nIn the longer version, **jIHvaD paq Danob**, the verb prefix **Da-** (subject = you, object = it) agrees more straightforwardly with the direct object.\n\nSimilarly, **qoqmey ghonob!** \"Give us the robots!\" would be understood the same way as **maHvaD qoqmey tInob!** \"Give the robots to us!\" -- **gho-** \"you!–us (imperative/command)\" will be understood with \"us\" as the indirect object because the direct object **qoqmey** is present.\n\nAs an example of a verb that cannot take a person as a direct object, **jatlh** \"to say, to speak\" can only take things such as languages, speeches, or sentences as direct objects. Thus **qajatlh** cannot mean \"I speak you\" but has to mean \"I speak to you\".\n\nThis abbreviated way of forming sentences using the verb prefixes in a different way rather than using **-vaD** is also known as \"the prefix trick\".\n\n##Noun-Noun\n\nThere is sometimes a temptation to use the **-vaD** suffix to relate two nouns when English uses the word \"for\", as in, \"a message for the captain\".  Klingon does not use the **-vaD** suffix for this kind of connection and in the vast majority of cases, you are better off using the genitive noun-noun construction: **HoD QIn** \"a message of the the captain\".","urlName":"Beneficiaries"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":40,"id":"dbfcae65efec9dddadb744ebb32b80d6","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":6,"levels":6,"name":"Cause","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Cause","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces the suffixes **-moH** and **-Ha'**.\n\n## -moH ##\n\n**-moH** is a Type 4 verb suffix - in fact, it is the only Type 4 verb suffix that we know of. **-moH** is used to form causatives; this feature is also present in several other languages, such as Esperanto's **-ig-**.\n\nFor example, from **poS** \"to be open\" one can form a new verb **poSmoH** \"to cause to be open, to make open = to open\". From **Sop** \"to eat\" one can form a new verb **SopmoH** \"to cause to eat = to feed\". From **ghoj** \"to learn\" one can form a new verb **ghojmoH** \"to cause to learn = to teach\".\n\nIf the root verb does not take an object, then the subject of the root verb simply becomes the object of the causative verb:\n\n- **poS Qorwagh** \"the window is open\"\n- **Qorwagh poSmoH mara** \"Mara opens the window\"\n\nIf the root verb can take an object, then there are several possibilities, depending on whether you want to name both the original subject and object, or just one of them:\n\n- **tlhIngan Hol ghoj tera'ngan** \"the Terran learns Klingon\"\n- **tlhIngan Hol ghojmoH lurveng** \"Lurveng teaches Klingon\" (original object stays object)\n- **tera'ngan ghojmoH lurveng** \"Lurveng teaches the Terran\" (original subject becomes object)\n- **tera'nganvaD tlhIngan Hol ghojmoH lurveng** \"Lurveng teaches Klingon to the Terran\" (original subject becomes beneficiary; original object stays object)\n\nThis means that something like **puq SopmoH torgh** \"Torg feeds the child\" can be ambiguous between \"Torg feeds the child (to the targ)\" or \"Torg feeds the child (with pie)\".\n\n**targhvaD puq SopmoH torgh** and **puqvaD chab SopmoH torgh** are clear.\n\n### -'eghmoH in commands ###\n\nAs you may remember from the \"Imperatives\" unit, verbs of quality (verbs that describe a state or quality, such as \"be hungry, be tired, be brave, be loyal\", rather than an action, such as \"run, walk, fight, eat, drink\") require **-'eghmoH** in the imperative or command form.\n\nFor example, \"be brave!\" would be **yIyoH'eghmoH!** to one person (literally, \"cause yourself to be brave!\") and **peyoH'eghmoH!** to several people (literally, \"cause yourselves to be brave!\").\n\nSince **-'egh** is a Type 1 verb suffix and **-moH** is a type 4 verb suffix, any Type 2 or 3 suffixes would come between them, but would otherwise not change the usage or meaning.\n\n## -Ha' ##\n\nThe verb suffix **-Ha'** implies un-doing something that you did or mis-doing something, doing it wrongly. Sometimes the meaning is also simply the opposite of the basic verb.\n\nFor example, from **yaj** \"understand\" we get **yajHa'** \"misunderstand\"; from **meS** \"to tie (a knot)\" **meSHa'** \"to untie (a knot)\", and from **par** \"to dislike\" **parHa'** \"to like\".\n\n**-Ha'** is officially classified as **lengwI'** (a  Rover) by Klingon linguists, but, in actuality, it doesn't rove the way **-be'** and **-qu'** do.  When **Ha'** is used it always comes immediately after the verb, including even before any Type 1 verb suffixes.","urlName":"Cause"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":16,"id":"ac08dedcf25718df1e0a4349a2695399","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Cause 2","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Cause 2","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit teaches the suffix **-mo'** and another use of the verb suffix **-Qo'** which we have seen before.\n\n## -mo' ##\n\nThe suffix **-mo'** means \"because (of)\" and appears as either a noun suffix or a verb suffix.  Klingon linguists treat these as two separate suffixes, one type 5 noun suffix and one type 9 verb suffix.  Most of the suffixes are unique and the few that do look similar have completely different uses and meanings (**-pu'** on a noun is a plural and on a verb indicates it is perfective, **-lI'** on a noun is a possessive and on a verb indicates it is \"in progress\").  Grammatically we separate the noun suffix **-mo'** from the verb suffix **-mo'**, but they both occur as the last suffix on a word (whether a noun or a verb) and they both mean \"because\" (when we use this noun suffix we often add \"of\" to the English translation).\n\nAs an example of using the noun suffix **-mo'**, from **vavwI'** \"my father\" we can form **vavwI'mo'** \"because of my father\". As an example of using the verb suffix **-mo'**, from **jIghung** \"I am hungry\" we can form **jIghungmo'** \"because I am hungry\".\n\nIf a noun is followed by an adjectival verb, then the **-mo'** ending goes on the adjectival verb; for example, **vavwI' HoSmo'** \"because of my strong father\".  Be careful to note that **HoS** cannot have a grammatical object and so has to be acting adjectivally here. Thus this cannot be the verb suffix **-mo'** and must be the noun suffix **-mo'** even though it appears to be on a verb.\n\nWhether being used on a noun or a verb, **-mo'** is always the last suffix.  A noun marked with **-mo'** (or a noun phrase consisting of noun + adjectival verb-mo') must appear before the object-verb-subject structure of the sentence. When **-mo'** is placed on the verb of a complete clause, the whole **-mo'** clause may be placed before or after the main clause of which it is indicating the cause.  Be careful to pay attention to the order of the verb clauses.  Since they can be in either order in both languages, we require you to translate them in the same order as presented.\n\n## -Qo' ##\n\nThe verb suffix **-Qo'** has come up on imperatives (command forms) before, where it turns the command into a negative: \"Don't ...!\".  This can also be interpreted as \"Refuse to...!\"\n\nWhen the verb is not imperative, the **-Qo'** suffix can also be used to mean \"refuse\".\n\nFor example, from **qagh Sop tera'ngan** \"The Terran eats gagh\" we get **qagh SopQo' tera'ngan** \"The Terran refuses to eat gagh\".\n\nOn non-imperative verbs the **-Qo'** suffix is often translated simply with the words \"will not\" or \"won't\" (only as an indication of refusal and not as a reference to future tense).  So **qagh SopQo' tera'ngan** can also be translated as \"The Terran won't eat gagh.\"\n\nThere is a subtle difference here from regular negation with **-be'**.  Compare:  \n**qagh Sopbe' tera'ngan** \"The Terran doesn't eat gagh.\"  \n**qagh SopQo' tera'ngan** \"The Terran won't eat gagh.\"\n\nYou may remember, from the Imperatives unit, that the **-Qo'** suffix is officially classified as a rover, but does not actually rove.  In that unit you were told that the **-Qo'** suffix would always come last, but there were exceptions.  These exceptions occur when using **-Qo'** on non-imperative sentences.\n\nAny type 9 syntactic verb suffix will always occur after the -**Qo'** suffix.  The type 9 syntactic verb suffixes that you have learned in this or prior units are the \"interrogative\" **-'a'** verb suffix, the \"if\" **-chugh** verb suffix, and the \"because\" **-mo'** verb suffix presented above.  Thus to ask \"Does the Terran refuse to eat gagh?\" a Klingon might ask, **qagh SopQo''a' tera'ngan**?  Or to say, \"If you won't buy, then you will die,\" a Klingon might say, **bIje'Qo'chugh vaj bIHegh**.  Or, the customer having already failed to make a purchase, the Klingon might say, **bIje'pu'Qo'mo' DaH bIHegh** (\"Because you have refused to buy, now you will die.\")","urlName":"Cause-2"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":14,"id":"18ed3f4994c922a0e8ce904f9972c822","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Space exploration","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Space","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces various words related to space, stars, planets, etc.\n\nIt also includes the word **tu'lu'**.\n\nThe grammar behind this will be taught more explicitly later, so for now, just learn **X tu'lu'** as \"there is an X\", and **Y-mey (lu)tu'lu'** as \"there are (some) Ys\".\n\nTechnically, the verb form should be **lutu'lu'** if there are many Ys, but many Klingons just say **tu'lu'** whether there is just one thing or there are many things.

When used in this kind of construction, the adjectival verb never takes a prefix, and pronouns may be used for the nouns which are being compared, for example: **jIH HoS law' SoH HoS puS** for \"I am stronger than you.\"\n\nIn the hints for translating Klingon to English, combinations such as **HoS law'** are usually glossed as \"stronger\" and **puS** is glossed as \"than\", but you can't just say *vavwI' HoS law' puS loDnI'lI'* for \"my father is stronger than your brother\" -- remember to put the adjectives after the nouns, to use them twice, and to follow one by **law'** and the other by **puS**.\n\nTo negate such a comparison, negate both **law'** and **puS**, e.g. **vavwI' HoS law'be' loDnI'lI' HoS puSbe'** \"my father is not stronger than your brother\".\n\n*As a side note, because \"A Q law' B Q puS\" structure is so distinctive, Klingons may use other pairs of antonyms than law'/puS such as HoS/puj, pIv/rop, Daj/qetlh, ghegh/Hab, Qatlh/ngeD.

In it's strictest use, this refers to one complete planetary rotation from one dawn to the next dawn.  The Klingon day can be divided into **pem** \"daytime\" followed by **ram** \"night\".\n\n### Today ###\n\nYou may notice that the word **jaj** appears in the timestamp **DaHjaj** \"today\".  It is also used in the word **jajvam** \"this day\".  **jajvam** seems never to be used as a timestamp, but is frequently used to refer to \"today\" in sentences as the subject, object, or topic of the sentence.  For instance in the famous Klingon aphorism, **Heghlu'meH QaQ jajvam!** \"Today is a good day to die!\"\n\n**DaHjaj** can also be used as the subject, object, or topic of a sentence, but it is rare to see it that way.  **jajvam** is mostly used for that purpose and **DaHjaj** is usually just used as a timestamp.\n\n## Time ago and time from now ##\n\nKlingon expresses notions such as \"x days ago\" or \"y days from now\" with special syllables combined with a preceeding number and do not use the word **jaj**.  \n\nSimilar syllables are used for months and years.\n\nYou will see the number and the time syllable written together as if the syllable was a number suffix, but you also may sometimes see them written as two words with a space between.\n\n### Time ago ###\n\n- **-Hu'** = days ago (**wa'Hu'** \"yesterday\", **cha'Hu'** \"the day before yesterday, **wejHu'** \"three days ago\", **loSHu'** \"four days ago\", ...)\n- **-wen** = months ago\n- **-ben** = years ago\n\n### Time from now ###\n\n- **-leS** = days from now (**wa'leS** \"tomorrow\", **cha'leS** \"the day after tomorrow\", **wejleS** \"three days from now\", **loSleS** \"four days from now\", ...)\n- **-waQ** = months from now\n- **-nem** = years from now\n\n*People who like mnemonics may find it useful to remember **waQ** and **wen** as \"months from now, months ago\" because the moon 'waxes' and 'wanes'.)*\n\n### How old are you? ###\n\nThe suffix **-ben** \"years ago\" is also used when inquiring about someone's age.\n\nWhen asking someone how old they are, Klingons ask how many years ago they were born: **ben 'ar bIboghpu'?**\n\nAnd the answer might be **wa'maH chorghben jIboghpu'** \"I was born eighteen years ago = I am eighteen years old\".\n\nIt is standard to use the **-pu'** syllable even though the English does not include \"has/had/will have\" and so we allow answers that do not include them for these phrases.\n\n### Other time periods ###\n\nFor other time periods that have no specific suffixes, such as minutes from now or weeks ago, you can use **ret** \"time period ago\" and **pIq** \"time period from now\".\n\nFor example, **wa' Hogh ret** is \"one week ago\" and **wa'maH tup pIq** is \"ten minutes from now\" -- literally, \"one week's time-period-ago\" and \"ten minutes' time-period-from-now\".\n\n## Days of the week ##\n\nThe days of the week in the Gregorian calendar commonly used on Earth are as follows:\n\n- **DaSjaj** \"Monday\"\n- **povjaj** \"Tuesday\"\n- **ghItlhjaj** \"Wednesday\"\n- **loghjaj** \"Thursday\"\n- **buqjaj** \"Friday\"\n- **ghInjaj; lojmItjaj** \"Saturday\"\n- **jaj wa'** \"Sunday\"\n\nThere are two words for Saturday. There's no difference in meaning between them. The longer one **lojmItjaj** tends to be used on formal occasions, but otherwise, both are used about equally frequently.\n\nThe days **DaSjaj** through **ghInjaj/lojmItjaj** are Klingon weekday names and are used in the Klingons' six-day week.\n\nWhen Klingons encounter calendars with more than six weekdays, they simply number the remaining days and call them \"Day One, Day Two, Day Three\" etc.\n\nThus our Sunday gets called **jaj wa'**, literally, \"Day One\".","urlName":"Time-from-now-and-time-ago"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":40,"id":"a5f4fe3d285919246fd603d6b973eda8","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Time suffixes","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Suffixes","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit teaches some type 9 syntactic verb suffixes that indicate when something happened or will happen.\n\n**-pa'** means \"before\", **-DI'** means \"when\" or \"as soon as\", and **-taHvIS** means \"while\".\n\n**-taHvIS** is really a compound of **-taH**, the continuous-aspect suffix which we have seen before, and **-vIS**, which conveys the \"while\" meaning and which is always used together with **-taH**.\n\nFor example, **bISoppa' ghopDu' tISay'moH!** \"Before you eat **(bISoppa')**, wash your hands **(ghopDu' tISay'moH)**!\n\nThis can also be said as **ghopDu' tISay'moH bISoppa'!** \"Wash your hands before you eat!\"","urlName":"Time-suffixes"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":18,"id":"52bae7c0518f7deedbdb9ee7201a2d50","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":6,"levels":6,"name":"Purpose","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Purpose","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit introduces the verb suffix **-meH** which is used for purpose clauses -- \"in order to (do something)\" or \"so that (something)\".\n\nTogether with the verb **lo'** \"use\", this also gives us a way to phrase things that would use the preposition \"with\" in English.\n\nFor example, \"he cut the fruit with a knife\" can be rephrased as \"to cut the fruit, he used a knife\" **naH pe'meH taj lo'**. (Note that the purpose clause *must* come *before* the other clause -- the word order **\\*taj lo' naH pe'meH** is not possible.)\n\nThe subject of the verb with the **-meH** suffix does not need to be the same as the subject of the verb in the main clause: for example, one can say **SulaDlaHmeH, Qorwagh vIpoSmoH** \"I open the window **(Qorwagh vIpoSmoH)** so that you all can read **(SulaDlaHmeH)**\".","urlName":"Purpose"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":40,"id":"a0817051392320a46b352d5bd023da1e","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Indefinite subject","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"IndefSubj","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This unit is all about the Type 5 verb suffix **-lu'**, called the \"indefinite subject\" suffix.\n\nIndefinite Subject\n---\nThis suffix indicates that the subject or actor is unknown, indefinite, irrelevant, or general.  We often indicate this in English by using generic subjects like, \"one\", \"someone\", or \"they\".\n\nFor example, **loD choplu'pu'** would mean \"someone has bitten the man\", \"they have bitten the man\", or \"one has bitten the man\".\n\nPrefixes\n---\nThe use of verbal prefixes in connection with this suffix is a bit unusual.\n\nThe prefix is chosen as if the patient or \"sufferer\" of the verb were the subject and the object were \"he, she, it\".\n\nFor example, \"it bites you\" (when speaking to one person) is **Duchop**, but when using **-lu'** to say, \"one bites you\", **Du-** is not used but instead **Da-** -- the form used for \"you (one person) do something to it\": **Dachoplu'** \"one bites you; someone or something bites you; they bite you\".\n\nThus, we have:\n\n- **vI...lu'** = one ... me\n- **Da...lu'** = one ... you\n- **...lu'** = one ... him/her/it\n- **wI...lu'** = one ... us\n- **bo...lu'** = one ... you all\n- **lu...lu'** = one ... them\n\nPassive voice\n---\nTo avoid expressing who is doing the action, English sometimes use the passive voice,  such as \"the man was bitten\".  The English passive voice is used to emphasize what would normally be the object of a sentence by placing it in the subject position.  You can add the preposition \"by\" to indicate who actually did the action (\"the man was bitten by the targ\"), but still emphasize that you are talking about a man being bitten and the targ is incidental.  However, if you leave the preposition off, then it becomes a type of indefinite subject.  If all I say is \"the man was bitten\" then who did the biting is left indefinite.\n\nAs we indicated earlier, **loD choplu'pu'** would mean \"someone has bitten the man\", but it can also be translated into the English passive voice, \"the man was bitten.\"\n\nNote that in the passive voice, English reverses the position of the subject and object:  \nThe targ bites the man.  \n**loD chop targh**  \nThe man is bitten by the targ.  \n\nWhen using the English passive voice, the ones doing the action and having the action done to them now appear in the same order as the Klingon sentence.  When doing the exercises this can be somewhat confusing because if you are given the passive voice in an English sentence, the receiver of the action will appear first and the word order will match the Klingon, instead of being reversed like you would normally expect.\n\nAlso note, however, that the use of the Klingon prefixes *does* seem to reverse and also now seems to match the English passive voice:\n\n- **vIHo'lu'** = one admires me; I am admired\n- **DatoDlu'** = one saves you; you are saved\n- **qagh Soplu'** = one eats serpent worm; serpent worn is eaten\n- **wIHIvlu'** = one attacks us; we are attacked\n- **bongejlu'** = one infects you all; you all are infected\n- **yIHmey luHoHlu'** = one kills tribbles; tribbles are killed\n\nIn the Duolingo exercises, pay attention for when you are given an English passive voice sentence and must translate it with the Klingon indefinite subject.\n\nThere is - tu'lu'\n---\nNow you can also understand the forms **tu'lu'** for \"there is\" and **lutu'lu'** \"there are\": they are based on the verb **tu'** \"find, observe\".\n\nSo **pa' puq tu'lu'** \"there is a child there\" literally means \"one finds a child there\" or \"a child is found there\".  And **pa' puqpu' lutu'lu'** \"there are children there\" literally means \"one finds children there\" or \"children are found there\".\n\n-lu' and -laH\n---\nFor reasons that make most sense to Klingon grammarians, it is not possible to combine the suffixes **-lu'** and **-laH** to create meanings such as \"one can see me; I can be seen\" or \"one cannot find them; they cannot be found\". **-lu'** and **-laH** are both Type 5 verb suffixes, so one or the other of those suffixes can be on a given verb but not both at once.\n\nIf such a meaning is desired, one way to express it is with a locution such as **muleghlaH vay'** \"someone can see me\" or **chaH tu'laH pagh** \"nobody can find them\" with an explicit subject **vay'** \"someone\" or **pagh** \"nobody\".","urlName":"Indefinite-subject"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":22,"id":"7f0f47043fdb2f635c7f0e1b0f19eb7f","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Sentences as objects","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"SentObj","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"So far, we've been using fairly simple sentences -- simply main clauses, or main clauses joined to each other by conjunctions such as **'ej** \"and\" or **'ach** \"but\".\n\nThis skill will teach you how Klingons do the equivalent of subordinate clauses -- things such as, \"I know that you have eaten my *gagh*,\" where the object of \"know\" is an entire clause including a verb, \"you have eaten my *gagh*.\"\n\n##'e'\nEnglish uses a subordinating conjunction \"that\" for this; Klingon uses a special pronoun: **'e'**.\n\n(This is a complete and separate word not to be confused with the topic suffix **-'e'** that can be added to nouns, such as in \"A is a B\" sentences.)\n\nThis pronoun **'e'** refers to a preceding sentence, and can go into the object position of a following sentence (i.e. in front of the verb).\n\nFor example, if one person says **qettaH mara** \"Mara is running\", another may reply, **'e' vIlegh** \"I see that\", referring with **'e'** for to the previous sentence, **qettaH mara**.\n\nMore commonly, however, two clauses are spoken by the same speaker, \"connected\" with **'e'**. Usually, no punctuation is used after the first sentence.\n\nSo you might also hear: **qettaH mara 'e' vIlegh** -- literally, \"Mara is running, I see that\", but equivalent to \"I see that Mara is running.\"\n\nNote that while in English, we might say, \"I know that you ate my *gagh*,\" with the word \"that\" or, \"I know you have eaten  my *gagh*,\" without it, the Klingon sentence must contain the **'e': qaghwIj DaSoppu' 'e' vISov**.\n\nThe only exception to this is the verb **neH** which means \"to want\" -- here, the **'e'** is left out.\n\nFor example, a Klingon might say **qagh vISop vIneH** \"I want to eat *gagh*.\" -- literally: \"I eat gagh. I want that.\"\n\n**'e'** counts as a singular object, so something like \"We know that the prisoners eat\" would be **Sop qama'pu' 'e' wISov**, with the prefix **wI-** indicating the subject is \"we\" and the object is \"it\".\n\nSimilarly, \"They want us to eat\" would be **maSop luneH** (literally: \"we eat; they want that\"), with prefix **lu-** indicating subject \"they\" and object \"it, that\".\n\nDon't be misled by English grammar and use something like *Sop nuneH* to try to say \"they want us - to eat\".  **nuneH** does mean, \"they want us\", but you can't use it to try to say \"they want us - to eat\".  In this type of sentence, \"we\" are doing the eating and so must be represented by the prefix on **Sop**, instead of on **neH**.  The Klingon grammatical object of \"want\" is the entire previous sentence (which for other verbs would be represented by the pronoun **'e'**, but **'e'** is omitted with the verb **neH**).\n\n##net\nAnother special pronoun is **net**.\n\nThis acts similarly to **'e'**, but in addition indicates that the subject of the verb is indefinite or general.\n\nFor example, **'e' Sov** means \"he/she knows that\", but **net Sov** means \"one knows that; it is known that\".  This is exactly equivalent to **'e' Sovlu'**, but when you want to use **-lu'** with **'e'**, you should use **net** instead.  For example: **val tlhInganpu' net Sov** \"It is known that Klingons are smart; One knows that Klingons are smart\".\n\n##poQ\nThe verb **poQ** does not have one good translation, so it can be confusing.  It is used to indicate a strong desire or something that feels as if it necessary.  It may imply a command or suggest a requirement, but it literally only expresses that the subject feels the object is very important to them.  **poQ** is often used with **'e'** to indicate what one desires to happen.  Most of the time, this course will translate **poQ** as \"demand\", but it is important to keep in mind that it is \"demand\" as in \"require\" or \"need\", not as in \"to make a command\".  In English one doesn't \"demand\" someone else, so when the object is a person, **poQ** is more often translated \"need\".\n\n##jal\nThis unit introduces the verb **jal** which is usually translated as \"imagine, envision\" and is very often used to express hypothetical situations: **tlhIngan SoH 'e' vIjal.**  This sentence can be translated directly as \"I imagine that you are a Klingon.\"\n\nIn English, we often express hypothetical situations like this with a subjunctive mood conjugation, so we might instead say, \"I imagine that you were a Klingon.\"  In this course we will accept either the indicative mood (regular past, present, or future) or the subjunctive mood.\n\nCommands using **'e'** with **jal** may sometimes translate the **'e'** as \"if\": **puvlaH targh 'e' yIjal** (\"Imagine if targs could fly.\")  In this course, we will accept either \"that\" or \"if\" in sentences like this.\n\nNote that the verb suffix **-chugh** also creates a kind of hypothetical situation.  The difference is that a **-chugh** statement is used to indicate a cause and effect and should include the result of the hypothetical.  A **jal** command is just asking the listener to imagine if such a situation were to exist.","urlName":"Sentences-as-objects"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":7,"id":"78a4a6dbbc39972c41f4f76b84468384","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Science Vocabulary","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Science","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Some more science vocabulary.\n\nAlso includes a useful verb **bop** \"to be about\", as in **HeySelmey bop paqvam** \"this book is about atoms\".","urlName":"Science-Vocabulary"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":22,"id":"5d53e0afcf0f4a8a24a13de0cbf44c26","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Particle physics","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Particles","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"This skill introduces some words from particle physics: protons, electrons, particle accelerators, etc.","urlName":"Particle-physics"},{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":50,"id":"efe7c2b53fcb53fc5d0858786d2201eb","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":3,"levels":6,"name":"Weather","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Weather","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Some words about weather and weather phenomena.\n\nNote that weather usually involves verbs in Klingon -- for example, **SIS** \"rain\" is a verb (it rains, it is raining) and there is no specific word for the noun \"rain\".\n\nIf you wanted to specify that a specific puddle, for example, was formed from rain and not some other source of water, you could call it **chal bIQ** \"sky water\", but that's more of a description than a separate word for \"rain\".\n\nNote that English needs a dummy subject \"it\" with weather verbs (it is raining, it snowed, etc.) but Klingon does not: **SIStaH, peD** etc. are quite sufficient.

In English we usually call this the length, but Klingons call it the height. Klingons apparently imagine measuring such long objects standing on end, instead of stretched out along a surface.\n\n**juch** & **'aD**\n------\n\nThe word **juch** means \"to have a width of ...\" and the word **'aD** means \"to have a length of ...\"\n\nFor something that effectively has only two measurements (in other words, one of the dimensions is negligible compared to the other two - such as a lid or a table top), **'aD** will give you the length and **juch** will give you the width.

There are three such suffixes and they are **-'a'**, **-Hom**, and **-oy**.  These suffixes will always come before any other suffixes (with the exception that if they are being placed on a noun formed from a verb with the type 9 verb suffixes **-wI'** or **-ghach**, then any verb suffixes retained in creating the noun will be before the noun suffixes).\n\n##-'a' (augmentative)\nThis suffix is placed on a noun to indicate that you are talking about a different version of the noun which is in some way greater, more significant, or more major to the normal, unmarked version of the noun.  The difference is usually more than just a simple size difference (which should be indicated, instead, with the verb **tIn**), but indicates a difference in power, capability, or importance.\n\nA **bIQ'a'** is not just a big area of water, it is an *ocean* or a *sea*.  A **pIn'a'** (*master*) could actually be physically smaller than a **pIn** (*boss*) in the same field.  And while the **vaS'a'** (*Great Hall*) is bigger than the typical **vaS** (*assembly hall*), what makes it the **vaS'a'** is the importance and power of the Klingon government that is seated there.\n\nThere is not really one good way to translate the suffix into English.  Some words might actually change completely to reflect the difference in English.  A **Duy** is an *agent* or *emissary* and a **Duy'a'** would be an *Ambassador*.  When there are not different English words available, you will often see **-'a'** translated as, *great*, though this can be confused with meaning, *wonderful*, and **-'a'** does not necessarily carry that connotation. Sometimes the word *major* works well, though in military contexts, this can be confused with the Terran military rank.\n\nPlease note that this suffix is *NOT* related to the identical looking interrogative verb suffix **-'a'**.  As you can see above, the noun suffix has a completely different meaning from the verb suffix.\n\n##-Hom (diminutive)\nThis suffix indicates the opposite quality from **-'a'**.  **-Hom** marks a noun which is in some way a lessor, more insignificant, or more minor version of that noun.  Again, size can play a role, but is usually not the determining factor (otherwise, you might be better off using the verb **mach**).\n\n**be'Hompu'** and **loDHompu'** are not just tiny **be'pu'** and **loDpu'**, but actually a *minor* version of those things (pun intended).  While a **lupDuj** is a *transport ship*, a **lupDujHom** is nothing more than a *shuttlecraft*.  And though a **veng** would be a bustling *city*, a **vengHom** would just be a *village*.\n\nWe see, again, in the words introduced above, the tendency to actually use different English words, when available to translate the different concepts.  Though at times, there isn't a different word available and words like *lessor* or *minor* are often used to translate the **-Hom** suffix.\n\nA good Klingon word to demonstrate all three version of one concept, might be the word **SuS**, which is translated *wind, breeze*, and with the **-'a'** suffix becomes a **SuS'a'** (*strong wind*) or with the **-Hom** suffix becomes a **SuSHom** (*wisp of air*).\n\n##-oy (endearment)\nThis suffix is rarely used by adults, especially in military or formal settings.  It is most often used by children and applied to relatives and pets.  It indicates a particular fondness, usually by the speaker, for the noun that it is attached to.  A child might call their **SoS** (*mother*), **SoSoy** (*mommy*), and their **vav** (*father*), **vavoy** (*daddy*).  While native speakers may have a good understanding of when or how to use this suffix, it is not recommended that adult learners use this suffix unless they are absolutely certain they understand what the ramifications will be.\n\nNote that the **-oy** suffix is the only known syllable of the Klingon language that begins with a vowel.  All other known syllables of the Klingon language start with a consonant (remember that the **qaghwI'** is a consonant).  There are more than a few syllables that end with a vowel, but no other syllables that begin with a vowel.  This could cause a theoretical problem if a noun ending in a vowel might have the suffix **-oy** placed on it, thus causing there to be two adjacent vowels (which is not allowed in usual Klingon spelling and pronunciation).

For example, **8 + 1 = 9** is **wa' boq chorgh; chen Hut**, where the verb **boq** is in the form for \"singular subject, singular object\" -- it does not take the prefix **lu-** for \"plural subject, singular object\" since the **chorgh** in that expression is considered singular: a \"pure number\" rather than a count of multiple things.\n\n##Subtraction\n\nSubtraction proceeds in a similar manner to addition, using the verb **boqHa'** \"dis-ally\" or \"dissociate from\".\n\nFor example, **13 - 8 = 5** would be read as **wa'maH wej boqHa' chorgh; chen vagh** -- literally, \"eight dissociates from thirteen; five forms.\"\n\n## Big numbers\n\nThis unit introduces number suffixes for bigger numbers: **-netlh** for 10,000, **-bIp** for 100,000, and **-'uy'** for 1,000,000.\n\nThese work just like the suffixes **-maH, -vatlh, -SaD/SanID** which you have already learned, for example, **vaghnetlh** is 50,000 and **cha'bIp wejnetlh SochmaH** is 230,070.\n\n## Multiplication and division\n\nExpressing multiplication and division works a bit like addition and subtraction, involving the verb **boq** \"ally with\" and **chen** \"form, come into being\".\n\n###Multiplication\n\nMultiplication is essentially repeated adding -- 4×8 is like adding 8 to itself four times.\n\nSo in Klingon, multiplication uses the verb **boq'egh** \"allies with itself\", formed from **boq** \"ally with\" and the suffix **-'egh** which indicates that the action of the verb is directed back at the subject itself.\n\nFor example, **4 × 8 = 32** is expressed as **loSlogh boq'egh chorgh; chen wejmaH cha'** \"four times, eight allies with itself; thirty-two forms.\"\n\n###Division\n\nDivision involves the verb **boqHa''egh** \"dissociates from itself\" -- for example, **27 ÷ 3 = 9** is expressed as **wejlogh boqHa''egh cha'maH Soch; chen Hut** or literally, \"twenty-seven dissociates from itself three times; nine forms.\"\n\n###Percentage\n\nA percentage may be expressed by following a number with **vatlhvI'**. \"1%\" may be expressed as **wa' vatlhvI'**.

For example, **paq ghajbogh be'** can either mean \"the book which the woman has\" or \"the woman who has the book\".\n\nContext may make it clear which meaning is intended, but if you want to be more specific, you can use the Type 5 noun suffix **-'e'** on the head noun which you want to \"extract\" or relativise; thus **paq'e' ghajbogh be'** is explicitly \"the book which the woman has\" and **paq ghajbogh be''e'** is explicitly \"the woman who has the book\".\n\nThis use of the Type 5 noun suffix **-'e'** is related to other uses like topic, focus, or emphasis, but does not typically indicate any of those things when used along with the **-bogh** verb suffix.  In this case it is usually just marking which noun is being relativized.\n\n##Choice of Type 5 suffixes\nIf you want the noun phrase formed with **-bogh** to be used as something other than the subject, object, or topic, other syntactic noun suffixes can be placed on the head noun instead of **-'e'**.  For instance, you can use **-Daq** to indicate that the phrase describes the location, you can use **-vo'** to indicate that the phrase describes the origin, you can use **-mo'** to indicate the phrase describes the cause, or you can use **-vaD** to indicate that the phrase describes the indirect object.  In each of these cases, the entire **-bogh** phrase marked in this way would be placed before the OVS structure of the sentence.\n\n##Multiple Adjectives\nNote that when using adjectival verbs like **chu'** (\"be new\"), using **-bogh** for a relative clause has basically the same meaning as placing the adjectival verb after the noun.  The noun phrases **paq chu'** (\"a new book\") and **chu'bogh paq** (\"a book which is new\") effectively mean the same thing.\n\nRelative clauses using **-bogh** are a good way to add additional adjectives to a noun.  We are not allowed to put two adjectival verbs after a noun, so we cannot say ?paq QaQ chu'? for \"a good new book\".  Instead, we can use the **-bogh** suffix on one of the verbs to create a more complex noun phrase:  \n**QaQbogh paq chu'** \"a new book that is good\" or  \n**chu'bogh paq QaQ** \"a good book that is new\"","urlName":"Relative-clauses"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":10,"id":"2d1c6765d7e067d9dcdfaa7029f09331","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Fingers & Toes","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Fingers","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"##Left and right\n\nTwo new words here are **poS** \"left side\" and **nIH** \"right side\".

Also, because the first use of the word is never combined with the suffix -**Daq**, this can sometimes be used to disambiguate:\n\n**pa' chaHtaH.** - *They are there.*\n\n**pa'Daq chaHtaH.** - *They are in the room.*\n\nInterior and exterior surfaces\n------------------------------\n\nIn Klingon, one always distinguishes between the interior and exterior top of an object, as well as between the interior and exterior bottom. The interior surfaces are those which can be seen from the inside, while the exterior surfaces are those which can be seen from the outside.\n\n| Klingon | English |\n|----------------|------------------|\n| bIS'ub           | *interior bottom*       |\n| 'aqroS           | *interior top*      |\n| pIrmuS            | *exterior bottom*      |\n| yor          | *exterior top* |\n\nThis distinction may sound somewhat technical at first glance, but it can be illustrated using an example from everyday life:\n\nLet's say you live in an apartment on the second floor of a building. Looking up and down, you can easily see your apartment's *interior* surfaces: You call the interior bottom (**bIS'ub**) your *floor* (**rav**), and you call the interior top (**'aqroS**) your *ceiling* (**rav'eq**).\n\nThe *exterior* surfaces, however, are not visible from inside your apartment. The exterior bottom (**pIrmuS**) of your apartment is the ceiling of the apartment *below* you.\n\nLikewise, the exterior top (**yor**) of your apartment is the floor of the apartment above yours. Alternatively, if you live on the top floor, the exterior top of your apartment will be part of the exterior top of the building itself: Its *roof* (**beb**).\n\n(We will discuss architectural terms in more detail in the next lesson.)","urlName":"location-nouns"}],[{"accessible":true,"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":2,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":18,"id":"c49b46b27ff5879f56170963e6867c49","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Architecture","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Archi","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"#Course notes still in progress\n\nVarious vocabulary connected with buildings and their contents.","urlName":"architecture"}],[{"accessible":true,"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":33,"id":"cceb864a21564ca23ab0560053d6b240","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Love","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Love","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"A handful of words related to love, marriage, and pregnancy.\n\nA note on **tlhogh**: this can be used either as a noun -- meaning \"marriage\" -- or as a verb -- meaning \"to marry (someone)\", as a gender-neutral variant of **Saw** (what a man does when he marries someone) and **nay** (what a woman does when she marries someone).","urlName":"Love"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":28,"id":"0397bb665df4218d866f5cb042d960fb","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":5,"levels":6,"name":"Home Life","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Home Life","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Some vocabulary connected with home life, such as television, bills, the Internet, and Christmas wish lists.","urlName":"Home-Life"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":10,"id":"d03dcbd1b1d6ed76c5e80b5de5bfe329","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":4,"levels":6,"name":"Health 1","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Health1","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Various vocabulary surrounding body parts.","urlName":"Health-1"}],[{"experimentIds":[],"experimentalLessons":[],"finalLevelTimeLimit":140,"finishedLessons":0,"finishedLevels":0,"hasLevelReview":true,"hasFinalLevel":true,"iconId":25,"id":"495a693d4238a761a39c201c0ec1aaee","lastLessonPerfect":false,"lessons":2,"levels":6,"name":"Magic","perfectLessonStreak":0,"shortName":"Magic","skillType":"NORMAL","strength":null,"tipsAndNotes":"Miscellaneous vocabulary connected to magic: both \"real\" magic with spells and also stage magic, the illusionist's craft.\n\n## Real magic\n\nRegardless of whether you believe that real magic and proper wizards exist, Klingons have words for such concepts.\n\n\"Magic\" is **'IDnar**, and a wizard or sorceror is a **'IDnar pIn'a'** (literally, a \"master of magic\") or a **reSwI'** (literally, a \"spellcaster\").\n\nA magic spell is a **tlheH**, and the verb for them is **reS** (cast).

There is no new grammar taught in this Skill, but a few of the words may be worth exploring in greater detail.\n\n#meHghem\n\nIt's been suggested that there is no single word in Klingon that corresponds to the English word \"art\". ...but then again, that is perhaps to be expected, seeing as it can be difficult enough to find two English-speakers who agree entirely on what exactly \"art\" is. Are video games art? Is twerking art? Are these Skill Tips art?  I'm not sure the answer is any clearer in Klingon than in English.\n\nThe Klingon word **meHghem** has been variously translated as \"art\", \"the arts\" and \"culture\", and encompasses a broad range of creative expression, including the visual arts (such as sculpture and painting) as well as music, drama, poetry, theatre and more.\n\nIn discussing Earth culture, the phrase **meHghem Qat** is sometimes used to refer to \"pop culture\".\n\n#vIqraq\n\nAlthough most people will agree that painting is a form of art, many will also argue that not *every* painting is a work of art. Indeed, no visit to a modern art exhibit would be complete without somebody exclaiming *\"You call this art? My five-year-old could have made this!\"*\n\nThe word **vIqraq** has been variously translated as \"work of art\", \"artwork\", \"artifact\", \"gizmo\", \"gadget\" and more, but a more general translation would be \"something that is manufactured/made\".\n\nAs such, it could describe a quilt, a machine, a necklace, a flower arrangement, a piece of furniture and much more. It also encompasses any sculpture or painting ... as well as any drawing made by the above mentioned five-year-old.\n\n#nagh beQ\n\nThe phrase **nagh beQ** is commonly translated as \"picture\" or \"painting\". However, broken down, it literally means \"flat stone\". This phrase originally referred to stone panels with engraved pictures on them, but this usage has since been expanded to encompass a much larger range of flat images.\n\nNote that this phrase consists of a noun (**nagh**) modified by a state-of-being verb (**beQ**).
